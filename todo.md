# list of thingies im too dum to do (because i'm natalie and i'm too busy being cute)

## Done

- get a header for blog post text
- find first image in blog to use as prreview image or specified one
- get meta data for image (size/file type)

- in the header for a paticular post the href goes to the absaloute path as if it were a
  blog post so it just 404's.
- generate random id for blogpost
- thread like system where visitors can reply to the main posts

## To do

- rss feed
- Live stream page with built in irc front end (and back end linked to an ircd we host?)
 - (partial completion, ircd setup, streaming setup, but no webpage integration)
