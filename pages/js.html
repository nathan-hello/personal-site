      This website has some amounts of javascript. This page tells you where.
    </p>
    <p>
      Natalie cares a lot about keeping JS to an absolute bare minimum. This said, a
      statically generated site like ours has inherent limitations. Namely, there isn't a
      server running code available to run per-request renders.
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn't meant to be a scary list of things you can't do without JS on our site,
      just an explanation. We're really happy with how little our site needs JS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are the areas that have JS:
      <ul class="text-xl">
        <li>
          On each blog post, we use htmx to grab the comments from the server, and then
          place the server-rendered html in the dom. Disabling JS means you won't see
          comments.
        </li>
        <li>
          On /natalie/tv there is a video player that will stream video if Natalie is
          serving content via our (other, non-web) server. The iframe that she uses to get
          the stream working in the browser uses JS. Disabling JS would mean you can't see
          this video.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>
