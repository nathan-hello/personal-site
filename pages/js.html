      This website has some amounts of javascript. This page tells you where.

      Natalie cares a lot about keeping JS to an absolute bare minimum. This said, a
      statically generated site like ours has inherent limitations. Namely, there isn't a
      server running code available to run per-request renders.
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn't meant to be a scary list of things you can't do without JS on our site,
      just an explanation. We're really happy with how little our site needs JS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are the areas that have JS:
      <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
        <li>
          On each blog post, we use htmx to grab the comments from the server, and then
          place the server-rendered html in the dom. Disabling JS means you won't see
          comments.
        </li>
        <li>
          On /natalie/tv there is a video player that will stream video if Natalie is
          serving content via our (other, non-web) server. The iframe that she uses to get
          the stream working in the browser uses JS. Disabling JS would mean you can't see
          this video.
        </li>
        <li>
          On /font, you can disable the Terminus font from the page. This just puts 
          "disable-terminus": "true" in your localStorage. This check also happens on
          each page load so you don't have to check it every time you visit or go to
          another page.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>
