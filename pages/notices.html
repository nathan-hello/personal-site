                        This website has some amounts of javascript. This page tells you where.

                        Natalie cares a lot about keeping JS to an absolute bare minimum. This said, a
                        statically generated site like ours has inherent limitations. Namely, there isn't a
                        server running code available to run per-request renders.
                </p>
                <p>
                        This isn't meant to be a scary list of things you can't do without JS on our site,
                        just an explanation. We're really happy with how little our site needs JS.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Here are the areas that have JS:
                <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
                        <li>
                                On each blog post, we use htmx to grab the comments from the server, and then
                                place the server-rendered html in the dom. Disabling JS means you won't see
                                comments.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                On each blog post, we use <a href="https://katex.org/docs/autorender">katex</a> to
                                render Natalie's latex
                                into html. Disabling JS means you won't see Natalie's math rendered properly. If you
                                have a good solution
                                for server rendering the latex to html without using perl or server-side js, I'm very
                                open to it!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                On /natalie/tv there is a video player that will stream video if Natalie is
                                serving content via our (other, non-web) server. The iframe that she uses to get
                                the stream working in the browser uses JS. Disabling JS would mean you can't see
                                this video.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                On this page, you can disable the Terminus font from the page. This just puts
                                "disable-terminus": "true" in your localStorage. This check also happens on
                                each page load so you don't have to check it every time you visit or go to
                                another page.
                        </li>

                        A note to Firefox users

                <p>
                        Natalie really likes the Terminus font, but unfortunately on firefox it looks like dog.
                        Something to do with the bitmapping or aliasing or something. It's just really blurry,
                </p>
                <p>
                        You can check the box below and turn off having Terminus as the font of our
                        website if you'd like. Click it again to re-enable.
