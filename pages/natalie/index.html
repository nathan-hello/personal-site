        "Hey hi, welcome you goobers, this is my little hang out spot (watchout for Nate he
        likes to invade, but he is just a silly). Aaaanyway, I'm nat, nice to meetcha, and
        here you can find the paticular tidbits that are currently interesting me, get ready
        for maths and computer stuff cause that's pretty much all I do [I joke, but sometimes
        its a little :))]" - nat 11/01/24 - 01:24+0000 OH FUCK IT'S LATE, OK I'LL FINISH THIS
        LATER\
        <br />
        Ok I'm back and I'm finishing it later tm, idk if this should be an about me or if I should
        just do it here but for now it'll be here and if that changes I'll link to that page here.
        <br />
        But I guess, here we go, there's not much to say. I'm 20, doing a bsc in maths, I'm a bonger
        and I spend most of my time on my computer, either fiddling with it cause my brain won't
        leave me alone unless it's 'good'. But for my media consumption, I enjoy songs by
        <a class="hover:text-nat-black-c01 hover:bg-nat-white-c01"
                href="https://vid.puffyan.us/channel/UCg_wKAWDFHa24RjSuTTbm5Q">
                Kino</a>
        and
        <a class="hover:text-nat-black-c01 hover:bg-nat-white-c01"
                href="https://yewtu.be/channel/UCOH7H-J4BAi-lR0c9MGwi7gd">
                Egor Letov</a>
        and most other forms of post punk, russian or otherwise.
        <br />
        I haven't played many games as of recently but I would definitely put oblivion, AoE2, M&B
        warband and HoMM 3 as my favrouites. Mainly cause I just play them a lot.
        <br />
        I really enjoy looking around at websites and I would like to make a page just full of
        links, maybe something like
        <a class="hover:text-nat-black-c01 hover:bg-nat-white-c01" href="https://websitereview.neocities.org/">
                this</a>.
        <br />
        Ok so the big two are maths and computers, the former is far too long to write about here
        but I have started a little mini series where I work through Allen Hatchers Introduction
        to Algebraic Topology, just as a refresher for my brain
        <a class="hover:text-nat-black-c01 hover:bg-nat-white-c01"
                href="https://www.reluekiss.com/natalie/2024/01/15/100010">
                here</a>.
        <br />
        With computers, I guess I should explain mine, I use void with dwm, there's a lot of extreneous
        software I use like
        <a class="hover:text-nat-black-c01 hover:bg-nat-white-c01" href="https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser">
                qutebrowser</a>
        and
        <a class="hover:text-nat-black-c01 hover:bg-nat-white-c01" href="https://github.com/ncmpcpp/ncmpcpp">
                ncmpcpp</a>
        , however all that you need to know is that I like to keep the software I use as simple
        and unobtrusive as possible. I won't plague you with another rant on free software, there's
        a million of those out there so
        <a class="hover:text-nat-black-c01 hover:bg-nat-white-c01" href="">here</a>
        and
        <a class="hover:text-nat-black-c01 hover:bg-nat-white-c01" href="https://archive.ph/21b4o">here</a>
        is one. As that is not the main reason I use it, but just that it works for me.
