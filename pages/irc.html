<title>Nat/e's IRC server</title>
<description>Join it at irc.reluekiss.com</description>

  <br />
  <p class="text-xl">
    Join our IRC server by connecting to <b>irc.reluekiss.com</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    If your client doesn't connect already, try enabling TLS. The server is over port
    6697.

    Natalie likes to use WeeChat because it's in the terminal. I don't go on it too much,
    so you're more likely to find her there.

    For the unintiated it may seem daunting to join on a completely new platform
    so of the multitude of clients available I have walked people through, <a href="https://hexchat.github.io/downloads.html">Hexchat</a>
    is by far the easiest to use.

    If you use windows please follow the above link and if using a *nix please use your appropriate package manager.
  </p>
    Upon first running you should get a context window enter a nick of choice then
    click [+ Add] (so you can see the new server in the server list. 
    You can rename it as you see fit at this point by double clicking on it in
    the list.
  <p>
    Then click [Edit...], there should now be a second context menu type in 
    server url as irc.reluekiss.com/6697 and enable the following.
    </p> 
    <pre>    
    [] Connect to selected server only
    [x] Connect to this server automatically
    [] Bypass proxy server
    [x] Use SSL for all servers on this network
    [x] Accept invalid SSL certificates
    [x] Use global user information
    </pre>
    <p>
    Once you are done editing click [(X) Close], select your network from the network
    list and click [Connect]. From there read the motd carefully.

    I have this idea for an IRC to HTTP conversion layer. Such that you point your this
    service to an IRC server, and you can have a nice interface for serving those messages
    over the IRC protocol, but from an HTTP (read: website) service. If anyone knows that
    this already exists (and I've looked far and wide), please do let myself or Natalie
    know. Otherwise, it sounds like a cool project that would allow for more web clients
    to exist for IRC. My ultimate goal for this is to make a fully featured twitch-style
    chat that uses IRC as the backend (just like twitch does!).
