So, I have always had escapist fantasies, as a child that read a lot of books, predominantly fiction, this probably doesn't come as a surprise. It is probably fair to say that many of those that read such novels like Isaac Asimov's Foundation, Terry Pratchets's Disk World and JRR. Tolkeins works would probably have stumbled across RA Salvatore. Many games of the late 20th century, and by games I really only refer to table top war games, had fictional books as supplementary additions, and Dungeons and Dragons was no different, though I am fairly sure that Salvatore is credited with much of the creation of the sword coast rather than the other way around. And, when I learned that the book series I so enjoyed reading (The legend of Drizzt) was actually a part of a much larger whole I was enraptured, I would spend weeks reading lore of dubious origins to squeeze as much out of the dying horse which is Faerun. Until I had a thought that didn't seem obvious to me at the time but in hindsight is usually HOW people discover role playing games, is creating your own worlds, so hopefully I can try an expand on some parts of the CyberPunk setting which in my opinion are sorely lacking.

Now to actually make sure this goes somewhere which isn't a life story, I wished to try playing a solo rpg, using Cyberpunk 2020 as the base system, similarly because I have never used it before. The thing with solo rpgs is trying to make yourself accountable to your actions, because I am the kind of person that when playing alone would rather spend my time stress testing the limits of a system rather than playing 'in good faith'. As such I thought creating a story following the events as they are played out in a ttrpg scenario would be a fun exercise. This first attempt will be following a predefined story called "The Slow Boat from Chiba", which is from the Night City Stories supplementary book, I will likely create my own scenarios if this ends up going well. I apologise in advance for my poor writing.

If I wrap any text with -- it was taken directly from the book, possibly with some minor alterations to fit the rest of the writing. The idea is to have a thought out guide for the direction and between them my attempt at writing out how the characters interacted without the nitty gritty of the Cyberpunk mechanics. Because if you have ever used Friday night firefight, 6 seconds in universe can quickly become 6 minutes.

One thing which I feel as if is not explored much or at all in the Cyberpunk setting is just how invasive and controlling cybernetics becomes with the knowledge that given how the much more despotic the corporations that are dealt with in their world would not blink an eye at having unnavigable firmware and proprietary protocols, operating systems, the whole she-bang. And what that would mean for your average cybernetics user is that let alone if they're not constantly phoning home, their would almost necessarily be an entire underground market of netrunners and techies/medtechies who would work together to create some kind of non invasive alternative so that on the off chance that they do land themselves in trouble they aren't immediately reported to the authorities or logged. Let alone all the issues that would be faced if trying to use different cyberware from different vendors that aren't interoperable due to aforementioned proprietary protocols. Furthermore, how do you charge these things? Do they just run off human ATP? Doesn't seem particularly reasonable, but the only alternative is batteries and well, it seems kind of funny that a lumbering cyberpsycho is more likely to just go kaput with their lack of conscious ability to know that they need to charge themselves up. So they just end up stuck within the jail cell of their metal bodies.

Also, I made the stats of the characters slightly over tuned as most encounters were designed for around four characters, and for ease of writing I didn't wish to introduce too many characters too quickly.

Sound, everywhere fills every nook and cranny of my skull. Even shutting off my sound amplifiers doesn't dull it: the relentless shouting of the crowd, advertisements blaring from neon billboards, the hurried steps of a hundred people with somewhere to be, and another hundred with nowhere at all. Even if I cling to the edge of the street, my lungs fill with the pungent wafts of burning CHOOH2 and tobacco.

I move cautiously down the pavement, every step measured and silent, making sure that not even a whisper could betray my presence. The neon glow paints the concrete in shifting shades of electric blue and violent pink, making the shadows dance like ghosts at my heels. I pull my coat tighter, its collar turned up as a feeble shield against the intrusive light, and adjust the strap of my worn backpack, my only lifeline in a city that knows no mercy.

My eyes scan the restless crowd, each face a blur in the chaos, while I weave between clusters of pedestrians with practised precision. I keep to the periphery, blending into the urban tapestry of the night. Every so often, I pause at a corner, ensuring that no one lingers too close, my heart thudding in time with the city’s erratic pulse. In this grim urban sprawl, discretion is survival, and I am determined not to become another statistic in this neon nightmare.

Hearing the tinny jingle—“Come today to Voltaire Bank for a 0.5% APR, and 3% for…”—echo through the rain-slick streets, I was suddenly transported back to that drenched, neon-lit night in the cybercafe, where the blue glow of my cyberdeck illuminated my desperate attempt to breach a booster gang's secure server for Frederick, the father I never had. I remember that night like a shattered data stream flickering across a broken screen. I’d parked myself in a back room of a decrepit cybercafe, rain slashing, neon reflections against grimy windows. My cyberdeck’s blue glow bathed my face in ghostly light as I prepared to break into the booster gang’s secure server—a desperate hack to help Frederick, who’d dragged me into this mess.

It began with the keystrokes of a dying hope: I bypassed layer after layer of black-ice, my fingers dancing over the keys in a frantic rhythm. I could almost taste the metallic tang of adrenaline as lines of code scrolled by, each one a promise of salvation. But then came the rogue ai, a cascade of error messages that shattered my concentration like a broken promise. I heard Frederick’s voice crack over the comm, sharp and accusing. "You sure you’re cut out for this, Natasha?" he barked, frustration and fear intertwining in every syllable. We argued, our words clashing like corrupted data in a system overloaded with betrayal and regret. I pleaded, I tried to salvage what I could, but the ICE was too relentless, and my defences crumbled under the weight of my desperation.

In that moment, as I stared at the cascading failures on my screen, I felt the cold bite of reality: I had botched the hack. My failure was not just a failed job, it was a death knell for the life I once knew. Frederick’s disappointment echoed in my ears, mingling with the harsh static of my malfunctioning deck. I knew then that I was cut adrift from the nomads, those wild-hearted renegades who had once embraced me as one of their own. The only refuge I had found since was the sterile confinement of coffin hotels—grim, impersonal cells where the neon outside was a cruel reminder of freedom lost. Low on eddies and with nowhere to turn my feet slowly lead me to a hole in the wall. Turning the corner, into the rubbish strewn alley between Sole jewellery store and a derelict cafe is a flickering sign "Lo-Life".

The Lo-Life is a neon bar on the edge of the combat zone. Here, rich kids mingle with hardened mercenaries and corpo lackeys hire muscle for their in-house wars. I've been idling on the high from my last run, the drinks flowing and the night alive. The band hasn't started yet—and maybe it won't, because this crowd can get mean.

Now, as I drag my feet into the Lo-Life, I’m haunted by every moment of that catastrophic night. Each flash of neon and every hum of machinery drags me back to that rain-soaked room, the bitter taste of failure, and the echoes of Frederick’s disappointed tone. The ghost of the nomads whispers through my memories, a reminder of a family I once had, and the friend I once trusted. But here in this seedy bar on the edge of the Combat Zone, I bury those memories deep beneath layers of synthetic whiskey and smoke, even as the past claws its way back into every flicker of neon light.

Under the harsh neon glare of the Lo-Life, another solitary figure sat at a weathered poker table. Mikhail was a study in contradictions: tall, lean, and draped in a suit that whispered of lost opulence, yet bore the subtle stains of countless sleepless nights. His eyes, dark and introspective, carried the weight of a man who once knew refinement but had been forged anew in the crucible of the Combat Zone. A hint of a smile, a blend of sardonic amusement and wistful regret—played at his lips, as if he were perpetually on the cusp of revealing secrets too dangerous to share.

"Oi, Mikhail! Are you going to fold?" someone called from across the table, the shout slicing through the low hum of conversation and clattering chips.

I looked up, the name resonating in the smoky haze. That call pulled me back into the moment, into the life I both cherished and loathed. Now, as I lean forward in my seat, I can't help but reflect on the nights that led me here. "Ah, fuck it, this is a shit hand anyway."

As my eyes scan the room of the usual suspects a lithe figure catches my eye, her focus was already lost in the flickering glow of the bar, as if she were trying to forget a story too heavy to tell. I paused at the edge of her orbit, my invitation swallowed by the swirling lights and the murmur of the crowd. For a moment, the charged air between us held the promise of something more, only to dissolve into the restless night. I retreated, letting the raucous banter and clinking glasses of my table reclaim me, while the brief connection faded like a half-remembered dream. I was deep in laughter at my usual poker table—a cramped corner where a ragtag crew of street punks bet their fortunes away—when I first saw her slice through the bar’s neon haze. There was something about her; a weariness in her eyes, as if the weight of her past had carved secret lines into her face.

"Miss me on the next hand Markus, I gotta go do some fishing."

"Uh, huh." was all he got out of the Jamaican. As I saunter over to the bar I call out to the barkeep loud enough for the woman next to me, "could you get me one more of these", pointing at the glass of whisky by the woman's hand "... and a screwdriver".

After I finished, I sat on the stool making sure it wouldn't break under the weight of the new bone lace, slumping my cyber arm over the counter. She barely glanced in my direction. I sat on a bar stool and leaned back, and I laughed, softening into a knowing smile. And she finally looked me in the eyes and I let a half-raised eyebrow do the talking—a silent, cheeky invitation that said, "Come over, see what’s behind these eyes." I pushed myself away from the table, feeling the pulse of the night in every step.

Next to them, a table of Sophistikatz swishes tails and twitches implanted whiskers. One of them rises, his orange cat eyes contracting under the strobe as he approaches. He stops at my table, extending a clawed hand—holding out a cell-phone to Natasha. "Yo, choom... it’s for you. Hand it back when you’re done, 'kay?"

-- Before she could react, an androgynous voice, smooth as liquid English, broke through on the line:

"Say nothing, only listen. When I ask for an answer, you say yes or no—nothing more. Warehouse 214. Wellborn Street. West 31st Street. If you desire employment, be there at 2 AM. The work is dangerous but rewarding and brief. Shall I expect you?" --

"Yes..?", as soon as she answers the line goes flat.

The call left a ghostly echo in the air, and for a long moment, Natasha sat frozen, the cellphone dangling loosely from her hand. I leaned in, catching the subtle shift in her expression—a collision of wariness and resolve. "That voice," she murmured, barely audible over the clamour of the bar, "it had a chill, too polished for a street rat." She felt my own pulse quicken as she mentally replayed the terse instructions: Warehouse 214, Wellborn Street, West 31st Street, and a meeting at 2 AM. Even through the distortion of the radio link, she could sense a meticulous calm in its cadence—a filtered timbre that told me this was routine for someone who’d done it one too many times.

"Who told you to do give me this?" asked Natasha, but the sophistakat walked off silently.
"Hey she asked you a question choom," Mikhail stood up and grabbed their shoulder in one swift motion.
"I don't know how this person got my number, but whatever it was if you want to know you will have to ask her." They said in a low purr, their feline eyes shifting to the side at Natasha.

Natasha scanned the room, thoughts racing as she pieced together the fragments. The voice carried the faint accent of a Japanese gentleman—too refined for her usual contacts—and that, coupled with the unnervingly clinical delivery, hinted at layers of professional detachment. A quick glance at her terminal clock confirmed she still had two and a half hours until the rendezvous, a window just wide enough for some prudent reconnaissance. 

She leaned in close to the barman, lowering my voice to a conspiratorial murmur. "Hey, have you seen any Japanese guy hanging around tonight?" I asked, my eyes darting across the dim glow of the bar. He paused, wiping down a glass before answering in a gravelly tone. "Actually, yeah—I caught a glimpse of him this morning," he said, nodding toward the back where Sherry usually slumped. "Sherry was babbling between sips about a well-spoken Japanese guy. Said he was asking all sorts of questions about you two actually if your names are Natasha and Mikhail, what time you show up, where you sit—like he had a specific interest. She mentioned he spoke proper English, like a corporate type, not the usual street talk."

Mikhail glanced at Natasha, he could see her resolve hardening, mingling with the bitter taste of past failures. "Looks like someone’s been watching us," he said low, his voice barely above the murmur of clinking glasses. She only nodded, her gaze distant yet determined, as if the call had awoken a dormant part of her—a part that still remembered the nomads, the fierce camaraderie of better days. The call was not just a job offer; it was a silent warning that someone out there knew us, knew our routines, our vulnerabilities.

In that charged moment, with the neon haze and the chaotic pulse of the Lo-Life all around them, they both recognized the stakes. For a moment, the grim darkness of our world seemed to narrow into that single, crystalline line of instruction. And as the call went dead, they silently agreed: the next few hours would be our chance to either turn the tables or be swallowed whole by the shadows chasing us.

After leaving the Lo-Life, they stepped into the rain-soaked alleys, our footsteps echoing in the neon-lit void as they made their way toward Warehouse 214. The silence between them was heavy, punctuated only by the distant rumble of Night City and the occasional splash of water. Mikhail broke the quiet, his tone low and conspiratorial. "Word is, everywhere south of 51st is rife with Arasaka Security. Nobody knows why, but I have seen reports—four armed AV-B’s roaming the streets and gunfire breaking out at random." She frowned and pulled out my comm unit, dialling her netrunner friend. His clipped reply came through almost instantly: "Natasha, I’m picking up something odd near the Arasaka Night City fortress—activity that’s off the books, but it’s definitely there." She glanced at Mikhail, whose eyes reflected a mix of caution and curiosity. "Well I guess we will need to stay clear of 51st, and I have just the thing," He says as he takes a couple brisk steps ahead of her and shows her a battered motorcycle neatly hidden behind a skip.

"Ain't she a beaut, want me to give you a ride? Though don't have a helmet to give ya," said Mikhail. 

Just out of the corner of her eye Natasha catches a vending machine the garish green and purple light pulsating to the rhythm of the synth coming from the speakers, which is otherwise unrecognisable due to the wear the machine has clearly gone through. "Give me one sec."

"Ok well don't get lost," Mikhail jeers. "Oh fuck, you..." she mumbles, but that's gone to the sound of the rain which slowly starts to pitter patter against the pavement, pulling her jacket over her head she looks through the cracked glass pane of the machine and there it was, synth-vac's, a synthetic cigarette that was made from straight hydrocarbons. Likely as cancerous as getting a daily x-ray, but never mind that, they were discontinued due to unknowingly being able to become a hallucinogen if heated just hot enough. "Ha, and they say they were discontinued, hey Mikhail, look what I found!"

"What?", he grumbles as he tows over his motorcycle. "Synth-vacs, though it looks like the machine is busted," glancing at the numpad you would normally dial on hanging off the side, it's wiring the only thing holding it in place. "Could you break in the window? 'don't really feel like wasting a bullet."

"Well what do you know, you don't see those every day, but before you ask, no, I am not taking one."

"Suit yourself."

Taking a step back Mikhail strikes the glass with his elbow, the reinforced glass buckled and broke, the pieces of glass smaller than marbles rolled around the floor. But as soon as Natasha put her arm in to grab them a small alarm on the machine went off. "You know that ride you offered, I might just take you up on that." Natasha said making a fake pout. // N1

"Did you not check the damn alarm, okay, get on"

Not wasting a moment the two climbed onto the motorcycle and were gone. Streets whizzing past as they made their way onto the elevated highway.

-- The two slowly make it out of the high rises, the distant wailing of sirens fade into the distance the constant hiss of the rain bouncing high off cracked asphalt is now the only sound they can hear. Not far ahead is the battered and rusty door of the warehouse. Number 214 written large in fading white paint. Better on foot from here. A small entrance door set into the large vehicle port provides access to the interior of the building. Darkness, but not complete darkness; Lo-Lite provides an adequate view. A figure steps forward, out of the shadows. Rumpled leather armour and leggings and a Militech Crusher strapped outside his right boot. An ugly face breaks into a dirty smile. "Hi, I'm Wilbur." Wilbur is not the man on the phone. He is a victim. Lured here by a Japanese voice and the promise of a big pay-off, Wilbur is about to be killed. This is a favour which Namsei Namura is performing for a friend. Wilbur is 38 years old. Too old to be on the street. In his youth he was a dangerous guy. Now he is slow and overweight. Many years of booze and drugs have had a debilitating effect upon his mind, however, and Wilbur is convinced that he is as good as he always was. He is also quite certain that each job will bring him that one big score. As referee you should portray Wilbur as likeable but stupid.

"Hey guys, don't you worry. Wilbur's on the job and that means all is well, choomba. I've been around. I know what's what. That's why they picked me lead this mission. I'm on the ball." --

Despite what he says, Wilbur is anything but on the ball. Still a couple meters from Wilbur, Mikhail turns his head and mumbles "This guy is either chromed out of his mind or higher than a kite." Wilbur lumbers over his rounded figure almost like a penguin waddling, "Why the long faces, we're all here to work on this together," a wide grin stretched across his face. "That seems like a nice ride, Yamaha '06, nice model, do you still have the dual torque module it comes with out of the factory?"

"Uh thanks... but no, the handling was always too stiff..." replied Mikhail tersely. "Yeah my friend said the same thing, I'll show you his shop some time, get you a discount if all this works out."

Natasha's hand on the Millitech Av holstered under her jacket she asks, "So what is the job?"

"Too early to say, too early to say." Is all Wilbur would say, all the while chuckling in an overly jovial way, with the two talking about Mikhail' motorcycle, Natasha reclined against the cold concrete of the warehouse under a small outcropping to try and escape the lashing rain which still manages to leak through the roofing and light a synth-vac. // N2

-- Above Wilbur's constant chatter the sound of splashing footsteps can be heard, the sound of a single man running towards the building. Soon after, the small entrance door opens and a silhouetted figure steps inside. A small man, perhaps 5' 6" in height, wearing an old style raincoat and beneath that a suit. Rain drips steadily from the brim of his hat as he closes the door and turns to face you. "Good evening gentlemen, I am so glad to see you all here. I also see that you have all met Wilbur. Good." The voice is similar to the one on the phone, but not the same. As the small figure removes his hat and unbuttons his coat it is obvious that he is Japanese. Moving forward he gives a broad grin which seems more chilling than cheery. He extends his hand to each character in turn giving a vigorous handshake to any who return the gesture. He leaves Wilbur until last and, placing an arm around the older man speaks: 

"This is Wilbur. Undoubtedly the best man alive for the task at hand. Isn't that right Wilbur?"

Wilbur smiles another dirty smile as the mysterious Japanese contact claps him on the back in friendly fashion. As you will have guessed, this is merely a meeting point. My employer waits not far from here. If you will all follow me..." With that he guides Wilbur to the small door through which he came, gesturing in polite fashion for the still-smiling Wilbur to precede him. The old street punk steps out into the rain for the last time. In a single fluid motion the contact draws and fires. A single shot, to the back of the head and Wilbur falls forward into the road. "My apologies. Wilbur was asked to come on a different matter and will not be joining us for this mission." Stepping over the body he does not bother to look down, but strides forward into the ever-pounding rain and on to the rendezvous proper. --

A small flashing comes up in the corner of Natasha's Vision, a small prompt appears in red text: "New radio band discovered: 25MHz 95db, would you like to tune in?", "Ugh I really gotta turn off that daemon, wait, what, why is that on the citizen radio band, and why is the signal so good?", discreetly running a command on her cyberdeck as the man is walking away pulls up a thermal readout of the room, and what do you know, that man has multiple white spots around his ears and the back of his head. Running another and jacking in all she can hear is modulated static. "Hmm encrypted too, this guy isn't messing around..." That thermal readout and static are fairly obvious signs of someone transmitting fairly high energy radio and if he doesn't want others to hear... In a hushed tone she grabs Mikhail's arm and wheels him around and says, "This guy is bad news, I'm not sure, but he seems to be transmitting radio constantly, so just assume everything you say can be heard by others."

"Okay, okay missy, just follow the guy, this is Night City everyone can already hear you."

-- Across another barren parking lot is warehouse 123, from the outside it looks like any other abandoned warehouse in the district, mostly whole but derelict and rundown. Following the man through to the entrance-way, there is the first clue that this place isn't quite as simple as it seemed. Though the area is untidy, dust and rubble lie strewn across the floor and the door hangs badly, banging continually. The only light in the room is the faint and distant glow of red LED banks to the group's right and left. One of these disappears as their guide slides a card into the wall. The door to their left opens, filling this area with a bright white light which momentarily dazzles those without suitable cyberoptics. 

As their vision adapts to the light within this room their attention is immediately drawn to the far wall, which is completely covered by a huge mirror. All the cyberoptics in the world won't help you here; what lies beyond the mirror is masked to their vision. As you stare into the reflected room you see the guide step into the room behind you. He closes the door and the security bank lights up. The room is sealed... Those who are calm enough to concentrate hear the faint white noise hiss of heavy duty ASD systems kicking in before a disembodied voice begins to speak; a flat, featureless English accent; Chip Chat. "Welcome, ladies and gentlemen ... / hope that you are well. I am informed that you are persons of honour. I hope that this is correct. "I have a need for companionship, and it would please me greatly to hear the conversation of a particular person who resides here... his name is Fargo Wells and I would like you to find him and bring him here to me. It is a task for which you will be paid of course. My assistant has all the relevant information. Contact him when you have succeeded. "Your fee will reflect the level of your success... that is all." 

The meeting, over the two turn to leave and are confronted once more by your enigmatic contact. He holds a large brown envelope in one hand and a cell-phone in the other. "All the information you require is contained in. here," he says, extending the envelope towards Natasha. "When you have found him, use this to contact me and I will relay..." He pauses, unsure of his software. "I will give you further instructions, dial two-four." With this he hands her the cell-phone and opens the door. --

The rain clawed at their faces as Natasha and Mikhail pressed forward through the skeletal maze of forgotten streets. The dossier weighed heavier than it should have—paper and ink concealing layers of blood-stained intent. Natasha flicked through another page, noting Wells’ last-known location in Sector 9, near the Damarith docks. It was a place where corpos dared not tread after dark, where booster gangs and dockworkers with empty stomachs ruled the night.

Mikhail’s gloved fingers tapped impatiently on the battered gas tank as they parked beneath the fractured glow of a broken mag-train overpass. "This is where people vanish," he muttered, eyes scanning the gloom. Natasha pocketed the dossier and keyed in a string of commands into her deck, hijacking a nearby public node. Grainy CCTV feeds bloomed across her HUD. "Wells was here. Forty-eight hours ago, moving cargo under Black Sand security," she whispered.

Mikhail adjusted the collar of his synth-leather coat, voice low and sharp. "Black Sand? Freelancers with delusions of military grandeur." Natasha nodded grimly, already assembling a mental map of known Black Sand safehouses and haunts. Wells wouldn’t hide alone, not without muscle to keep predators at bay.

Just as Natasha prepared to close the feed, her HUD flickered, hijacked momentarily by a sharp burst of static. A lone frame stuttered onto the screen: Wells, unmistakable in a faded corporate trench, flanked by two Black Sand operatives. The timestamp confirmed it—less than an hour ago, moving toward the old Dockyard Processing Facility on the western fringe.

"They’re moving him," Natasha said, her voice hard. "They’re close."

Mikhail exhaled through clenched teeth, hand resting on the grip of his Nova revolver. "If we’re fast, we can box them in before they vanish." Yet both knew that every second they lingered gave Namura’s unseen eyes more time to adjust, more time to tighten the noose.

They mounted up once more, shadows devouring their figures as they disappeared into the skeletal sprawl. Alongside the pulse of their stolen data, Natasha monitored the unrelenting ping of the bugged cell-phone still buried in her coat. "Soon as we have Wells," she said, "we dump this thing. No way they’re tracking us to the meet."

The duo tore through the industrial wasteland, neon reflecting off wet concrete like distant fires. As the Dockyard loomed on the horizon, silent and ominous, Natasha's thoughts sharpened to a single point: get Wells, break the leash, and vanish before Night City’s wolves circled back.

And in the blur of headlights and shattered glass, only one truth remained: in this game, no one leaves clean.

Okay, well that is it for now, chapter 1 of the slow boat from Chiba, I hope this wasn't too boring to read, hopefully Nate and I will figure out a neat way of adding the character sheets so that you can follow along what's going on in the ttrpg part of this story. However, you need not really worry, not much really happened to them as yet.
