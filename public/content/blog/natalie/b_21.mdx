Whilst writing this I remembered [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHGDGLMpXAg) awesome car chase from Gunsmith Cats that I recommend anyone to watch as a demostration of how amazing a 2d drawn vehicle scene can look.

Rain drummed a slow rhythm on the pavement, fading to a mist that clung to skin and street alike. Natasha squinted into the drizzle, wiping droplets from her cyber-optics as they blurred briefly. The long black sedan had vanished into the night, leaving behind an eerie silence punctuated only by the distant hum of generators and the soft glow of corporate streetlamps. Baker Street was quiet—too quiet for comfort—but maybe that was just paranoia whispering through her nerves.

221 C loomed ahead, the building’s archaic façade a striking contrast against Night City’s endless neon. Natasha stepped cautiously into the lobby, eyeing the inner door. Wood, but not. Reinforced steel beneath an elegant veneer. A sign beside the panel of call buttons flickered slightly: For Visitors' Use.

With deliberate calm, she pressed the button marked Apartment C.

The vidscreen sputtered, springing to life with the grotesque, pig-like visage of a woman whose broad face and garish scar made Natasha recoil instinctively.

"Yeah, wadda ya want?" barked the face, irritation oozing through the digital static.

Natasha hesitated only a second before replying, "We have a mutual acquaintance. Fargo Wells. Strictly business."

As quickly as the monstrous visage appeared, it melted away, revealing the delicate features and golden complexion of a strikingly beautiful woman, her tawny curls spilling gracefully around slender shoulders. Natasha blinked, momentarily stunned by the flawless realism of Caitlin Jones’s answering system.

"Of course," Caitlin purred, voice now honey-smooth. "Come on up. But just you."

Natasha glanced back at Mikhail, who stood leaning against the opposite wall of the hallway, his cybernetic fingers twitching impatiently at his side. He raised an eyebrow, silently questioning. Natasha shrugged slightly, murmuring a quick "Wait here," before stepping through as the door clicked open with a mechanical sigh.

The contrast between Night City’s grimy underbelly and the lavishly furnished apartment was stark. Soft lights bathed the room in gentle amber; quiet jazz hummed from hidden speakers. Natasha let the ambience wash over her, briefly intoxicated by the illusion of peace.

Caitlin poured two glasses of aged scotch, handing one smoothly to Natasha. "Drink?" she asked with a warm, enigmatic smile.

Natasha accepted silently, eyes flicking briefly around the room. It was clear Caitlin Jones was more than a mere exec. Everything here—every touch, every scent—was calculated, deliberate, a carefully constructed façade of softness and vulnerability.

"Fargo Wells," Natasha said finally, forcing her voice steady as she broke the spell. "We need to find him."

Caitlin leaned forward, gently clinking her glass against Natasha’s. "Straight to business. I like that," she said softly. Yet Natasha caught the flicker of something else in her eyes, a guarded sharpness beneath the practiced allure. "Fargo is trouble, but you probably know that already. He burned a lot of bridges in Night City."

Natasha nodded, setting down her glass. "If you can tell me where he might be holed up, we’ll leave you alone."

Caitlin’s lips twitched upward in amusement. "Oh, I don’t mind your company, Natasha. But Fargo—he's got nowhere left but the Zone. If I were you, I'd start looking at either The Garbage Pail or Fast Eddy’s." Her expression twisted slightly, distaste evident. "Knowing Fargo, probably both. That scum never did have any class."

Her voice carried a subtle bitterness, a veiled anger that hinted at something deeper. Natasha felt a flicker of doubt; Caitlin’s contempt was believable, but something about it felt too rehearsed, too polished.

"Sounds personal," Natasha probed carefully.

For a heartbeat, Caitlin’s practiced mask slipped, a fleeting look of genuine anger flashing across her elegant features. "Personal enough," she replied quietly, swiftly regaining her composure. "But that's irrelevant. Fargo's burned enough people to deserve whatever’s coming."

Natasha felt Caitlin lean closer, warmth radiating from her as she brushed lightly against Natasha’s shoulder. The subtle, tantalizing fragrance of expensive perfume mingled in the air. For a split second, Natasha almost allowed herself to believe the intimacy was real—but years in the shadows had taught her better. Something brushed gently against her back—a feather-light touch easily mistaken for seduction, were it not for Natasha’s finely tuned paranoia.

Her muscles tightened, awareness sharpened. Caitlin Jones was good, very good, but Natasha had spent her life anticipating betrayal. It was clear enough: she’d been bugged.

Feigning ignorance, Natasha rose slowly, offering Caitlin a cool, professional smile. "Thanks for your help," she said evenly. "We’ll check both locations."

Caitlin returned the smile, smoothly guiding Natasha toward the door. "Good luck out there," she purred.

Natasha stepped into the hallway, forcing her expression blank as the door clicked shut behind her. She exhaled slowly, mentally cataloging the tracker’s location, before turning back to Mikhail, whose wary gaze silently asked for details.

"Zone dive," Natasha said simply. "Garbage Pail and Fast Eddy’s."

Mikhail’s jaw tightened slightly. "Great," he muttered dryly. "Sounds like my kind of place."

>Fast Eddy’s Pool Hall

Rain seeped through cracked neon as Natasha and Mikhail stepped cautiously into Fast Eddy’s, a grimy dive hidden deep within the labyrinthine alleys of 24th Street. The dim glow of a single bulb illuminated two figures hunched over a pool table: an older man—Toothpick, judging by Fargo’s dossier—and a young, nervous-looking punk.

Toothpick’s eyes flicked upward briefly, dismissive. "Already told them other fellas," he muttered, voice heavy with irritation. "Ain't seen Fargo Wells in a year, don’t care what you offer me."

Mikhail stepped forward, placing a small stack of eddies on the table. "We’re not them. Talk."

Toothpick sighed wearily, pocketing the cash. "Couple Arab heavies came by an hour ago, asking after Fargo. They only perked up when I mentioned The Garbage Pail. Dunno why—place is a shithole. Even Wells wouldn’t sink that low."

Natasha exchanged a knowing glance with Mikhail, her thoughts racing. The Arabs meant trouble, another complication. But at least it was a trail, something concrete to follow.

The Garbage Pail

Eight blocks west of The Crossroads, Natasha and Mikhail stood at the very bottom of Night City's food chain. The Garbage Pail was every gutter story rolled into one—where people didn’t just fall through the cracks; they rotted there.

Approaching the bar, Natasha's cyber-optics compensated for the patchy neon lighting. A surge of chromebeat blasted out from the club, reverberating painfully through her skull. The crowds milled aimlessly, shadows of desperation shuffling through the street’s gloom. A woman, her eyes glassy and vacant, tugged gently at Natasha’s arm. Turning to brush her off, Natasha recoiled as the flickering streetlamp revealed a gaping hole in the puppet’s cheek, flesh dangling grotesquely. Oblivious, the woman stumbled away into the darkness.

“If I ever fall this far,” Mikhail growled, eyeing the decay around them, “end me quick.”

Natasha was silent, scanning the street before suddenly grabbing Mikhail's arm and pulling him into cover beside a rusted-out vehicle husk.

Across the street, beneath the dim glow of a sputtering streetlamp, two men in traditional Arab garb stood guard by a pristine Toyota 4x4—brand new and completely out of place in the decaying Zone. Their stance was unmistakably military, weapons hidden but clearly at the ready.

“Trouble,” Natasha hissed.

“Arabs,” Mikhail whispered back, narrowing his eyes. “Same ones Toothpick warned us about?”

Natasha nodded. “Looks like we're not alone hunting Wells tonight.”

They slipped quietly through the door of The Garbage Pail, only to immediately be slammed by the acrid stench of rot and decay. Mikhail retched slightly, covering his mouth as Natasha fought back her own nausea, the bile rising in her throat at the sight—and smell—of refuse piled ankle-deep across the sticky floor.

Stumbling deeper into the dimly lit room, Natasha's cyberware automatically muted the relentless pounding music from behind the smeared bulletproof barrier. She focused, eyes scanning through the haze of smoke, sweat, and cheap synthol. Fargo Wells was supposed to be here—but where?

It didn't take long. Fargo’s carefully groomed hair and clean-cut features stood out painfully in this cesspit. He noticed Natasha almost simultaneously, eyes widening in shock and recognition. But before either could react, Fargo’s head exploded in a shower of blood and gore, his body collapsing lifelessly into the filth.

“Shit!” Mikhail shouted, his revolver instantly drawn.

Natasha tracked the shot’s origin in time to glimpse the assassin—a lean Arab with a smoking Stemmeyer 35—ducking down beside Fargo’s body, quickly snatching something from the corpse’s pocket.

“The bastard’s looting Wells!” Natasha snapped. “Move!”

Chaos erupted. The crowd, mostly oblivious to the killing amidst the pounding chromebeat, reacted only to Natasha and Mikhail’s sudden rush forward, scattering like panicked rodents. The Arab assassin glanced up, spotting the incoming pair. In an instant, he turned, sprinting for the exit, slipping expertly through the confused crowd.

“Stop him!” Natasha screamed, trying to get a clear shot, but bodies obstructed every angle.

A second Arab appeared in the doorway, raising his pistol with cold precision. A single shot ricocheted violently off the wall beside Natasha's head, showering her with sparks and concrete dust.

Mikhail crouched low, firing twice rapidly, forcing the second attacker into cover. Natasha surged forward, cyberoptics locking onto the fleeing assassin as her targeting reticle desperately tried to predict his zigzagging path. She fired once, twice—missing narrowly, glass shattering wildly.

Outside, the Arab assassin dove toward the Toyota, his companions already shouting urgently into a comm unit, drawing rifles from beneath the seats.

“Don’t let him get away!” Natasha shouted desperately.

She and Mikhail burst from The Garbage Pail, pistols blazing into the rainy night. Bullets bit into the asphalt, slamming the Arabs back behind their armored vehicle. The assassin vaulted into the driver's seat, fumbling Fargo’s stolen key—a sleek hotel card shimmering briefly in the rain.

“That key!” Natasha shouted. “We need that!”

Mikhail gritted his teeth, eyes narrowing as the Toyota roared to life. He dropped into a shooter’s stance, firing methodically, emptying his revolver at the fleeing vehicle. Glass splintered; tires squealed—but the 4x4 didn’t stop, speeding away down the alley.

“Bike! Now!” Natasha yelled, already sprinting toward Mikhail’s Yamaha.

They leapt aboard, engine roaring to life as Natasha slammed a fresh clip into her Millitech. The wind and rain lashed her face, her vision overlaid with tactical data as she targeted the retreating vehicle. Ahead, the Toyota swung violently onto a cracked freeway ramp, the Arabs inside firing desperately through shattered windows.

“Hang on!” Mikhail shouted, throttle wide open.

A hail of bullets struck sparks around them as Natasha twisted in the saddle, returning fire. She squeezed the trigger, her aim true. A tire exploded violently, sending the Toyota swerving into the guardrail with a screech of tortured metal.

“Got them!” she shouted triumphantly—but the Arabs weren’t finished yet.

The doors swung open violently, three heavily armed men emerging into a disciplined combat stance. Natasha’s heart raced. She recognized cyberoptics flickering coldly beneath the Arabs’ headgear, and the ominous glint of monokatanas.

The lead assassin shouted angrily, gunfire ripping toward the motorcycle.

“Cover!” Mikhail yelled, skidding the bike behind an overturned cargo container as bullets sliced dangerously close.

Pinned down and outnumbered, Natasha quickly scanned their surroundings. Rain lashed the pavement; her breath came in harsh gasps. They had seconds before the Arabs flanked them.

Mikhail swiftly reloaded his revolver, face grim. “This ends here. Ready?”

Natasha nodded sharply, cyberoptics locking onto the approaching assailants. With a silent signal, the pair surged from cover, weapons blazing. Gunfire filled the night, echoing through the crumbling Zone.

The Arabs returned fire, bullets shredding through crates and abandoned vehicles, but Natasha and Mikhail pressed on relentlessly, closing distance rapidly. Natasha’s Millitech barked, catching one assassin squarely in the chest—his skinweave insufficient against close-range firepower.

Mikhail pivoted, narrowly avoiding a micro-missile launched from another Arab’s cyberarm. The blast blew apart nearby trash, sending shrapnel tearing painfully across his jacket. Mikhail stumbled but recovered swiftly, emptying his revolver into the cybered attacker, dropping him instantly.

Only one assassin remained—the leader. Desperation flashed across his eyes. He charged wildly, monokatana gleaming lethally. Natasha dodged narrowly, blade slicing air inches from her throat. She retaliated instinctively, shooting at point-blank range. He staggered backward, collapsing onto rain-slicked concrete.

In the sudden silence, the night seemed to pause, breathing heavily. Natasha stepped cautiously forward, retrieving the blood-slick hotel key from the Arab’s limp hand.

She looked up, meeting Mikhail’s tense gaze. Around them, sirens wailed distantly, approaching rapidly.

“Shit,” Natasha muttered, clutching Fargo Wells's blood-stained hotel key tightly in her hand. Wells was dead—any chance of delivering him alive was gone, splattered across the floor of The Garbage Pail. Rain hammered down relentlessly, mixing with blood as it pooled on the cracked pavement.

Mikhail glanced around warily, ears still ringing from the firefight. “So, what's the play now? Head straight to Fargo’s hotel, or report back to our *mysterious employer*?”

Natasha hesitated, eyes narrowed. The mission had changed dramatically—Wells was supposed to be delivered alive. Now they had nothing but questions, and a hotel key. Her thumb brushed lightly over the cheap cell-phone the Japanese man had provided. A choice loomed, dangerous and uncertain.

“Better keep the boss informed,” she finally said, reluctantly punching in the code: two-four.

The line buzzed once, then abruptly went silent. Natasha frowned, about to redial, when the phone suddenly rang, startling her. She lifted it cautiously to her ear, recognizing immediately the cold, synthetic monotone of Namsei Namura.

There was no greeting, only silence awaiting her explanation. She spoke carefully, summarizing the firefight, Fargo Wells’s death, and the recovered key. Throughout, Namura was perfectly silent—not even his breathing audible.

When she finished, there was another pause, heavy and ominous.

Finally, Namura spoke, his voice impossibly calm, devoid of anger or surprise. “Fargo Wells was a thief. He stole from my superiors something best described as genetic data. It is imperative that this data be retrieved. Given the circumstances, I believe Wells intended to sell it. It must still be hidden somewhere within this city.”

He paused again, allowing the gravity of his words to sink in.

“Find the data, and you will be compensated well.”

The line went dead.

Natasha lowered the phone slowly, turning to Mikhail, whose gaze had hardened with renewed resolve.

“Well,” he growled, stepping toward the Yamaha, “I suppose it's time we found out what Fargo was hiding.”

Natasha pocketed the phone, following closely as they vanished into the shadows, moving quickly towards Fargo’s last known refuge—the hotel that promised answers, secrets, and inevitably, more danger.

Night City might never forgive, but tonight it had given them another chance.
