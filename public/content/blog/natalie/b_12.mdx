So, alsa, I began using it for quite practical purposes in that my laptop's
internal microphone would choose to not work with pulseaudio. The sound 
enviroment that my distribution (void linux xfce glibc) shipped with. Figuring 
if I went further down the stack I would have more control as to what on earth 
had gone so terribly wrong that dozens of hours turning random dials in the
forms of altering configuration files to no avail. So instead I set my eyes on
the monolithic asoundrc file. We will start where I started my journey, figuring
out, why on earth could I only hear one source of audio at a time? And the
answer is, dmix. Which will be a common theme. I would like to point out this 
is not a complete guid detailing all of alsa as there are a lot of use cases
and exponentially more configurations. But these are things that I have learned
with some hopefully motivating reasons.

Lets first aquiantence ourselves with quite possibly the simplest configuration
file we can. Which can either be found as .asoundrc for a user and /etc/asound.conf
for system wide.
```
#01
pcm.!default {
    pcm "hw:0,0"
}

ctl.!default "hw:0"
```
Now there is still a bit to get through here. The first thing to learn about
are keys and values where you can have a variety of delimiters between the 
two look [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture) in the arch wiki in section 3.1.1 first to have a look at them
you reference subkeys of keys using a "." as you might a method in a lot of 
programming languages. For example our ctl.default "hw:0" is a perfect example
of key.subkey value.

A quick aside, "hw:0,0" refers to the paticular sound card in your laptop,
which you can get a more detailed output for using ```aplay -l```, also, if
you ever wish to change the order of them you can do so by editing the
/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf file, explaning what occurs beyond indexes is
outside of the scope of this. But for an example it could look something like
mine
```
options snd-hda-intel index=0
options sof-intel-dspcfg dsp_driver=3 index=1
options snd_usb_audio index=2
options snd-aloop index=4 enable=1 pcm_substreams=4 id=Loopback
```
I mentioned earlier how with just this we wouldn't get very far as what if we
wanted to listen to multiple sources of audio (PCM streams) at once, or having a
microphone, or even just more speakers. In time, but first we shall talk about
plugins. Namely dmix, dsnoop and asym. 

With a short explanation, dmix is a software mixer that allows you to overlay
two audio outputs on top of one another. While dsnoop does much the same but 
for audio inputs. Now unfortunately it's useful to know some jargon here. As 
nice as inputs and outputs are, they can be restrictive when you start talking
about loops and multichannels, and what is an output or an input. So, someone
decided to name them sources and sinks or inputs and outputs. You will see these
on forums if you ever try to look up more stuff. So, look out foor it.

So our new configuration
```
#02
pcm.!default {
    type asym
    playback.pcm "dmixed"
    capture.pcm "dsnooped"
}

pcm.dmixed {
    type dmix
    ipc_key 1024
    ipc_key_add_uid 0
    slave {
        pcm "hw:1,0"
        period_time 0
        period_size 1024
        buffer_size 4096
        channels  2
    }
    bindings {
        0 0
        1 1
    }
}

pcm.dsnooped {
   type dsnoop
   ipc_key 1025
   slave {
       pcm "hw:1,7"
       period_time 0
       period_size 1024
       buffer_size 4096
       channels 2
    }
    bindings {
           0 0
           1 1
    }
}
```
Much here is the same where all we need to remember is that we can feel free to 
nest as many keys within each other as we wish such as slave inside of dsnooped.
I would like to point out that dsnooped and dmixer are completely arbitrary names
used to determine the names of the pcm streams. The period time, size and buffer
size are actually a more round about method of setting a refresh rate. Where here
$1024*4096 \approx 44100$ which is the refresh rate we all know. Though do feel
free to replace it as 
```
#03
pcm.dsnooped {
   type dsnoop
   ipc_key 1025
   slave {
       pcm "hw:1,7"
       rate 44100 #48000
       channels 2
    }
    bindings {
           0 0
           1 1
    }
}
```
The bindings just make sure that the left channel goes to the left channel and the
right channel goes to the right. The ipc key gives it a unique id so that there
isn't crosstalk between pcm streams. This is currently not that important but when
we introduce the next part it will. Which is loopbacks and multichannels. The former
sounds quite simple, you have one source or sink and you would like to pass it over 
to another. For example, to be able to hear the input of my microphone through my
speakers.

The reason I came across this was to be able to use a music visualiser named alsa.
(Which is very cool if you haven't heard about it check it out [here](https://github.com/karlstav/cava).

First we need to set up loopback, which to do we will need to download the snd-aloop
kernal module from your package manager of choice. As I use void it would be
```
sudo xbps-install snd-aloop
```
Then using /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf as we mentioned before we must insert the
line "options snd-aloop index=4 enable=1 pcm_substreams=4 id=Loopback" where the
index is the order it is loaded enabling enables it, pcm_substreams limits the 
number of virtual devices to 4 rather than 8 which feels like too many. And the
id, being the name of the device.

Now we can return to the asoundrc 
```
#04
pcm.dmixerloop {
    type dmix
    ipc_key 2048
    ipc_perm 0666 # allow all users read write permissions
    slave.pcm "hw:Loopback,0,0"
    slave {
        period_time 0
        period_size 1024
        buffer_size 4096
        channels 2 # must match bindings
    }
    bindings {
        0 0
        1 1
    }
}

pcm.out {
    type plug
    route_policy "duplicate"
    slave.pcm {
        type multi
        slaves {
            a { channels 2 pcm "dmixed" }  
            b { channels 2 pcm "dmixerloop" }  
        }
        bindings {
            0 { slave a channel 0 }
            1 { slave a channel 1 }
            2 { slave b channel 0 }
            3 { slave b channel 1 }
        }
    }
    ttable [
        [ 1 0 1 0 ]   
	      [ 0 1 0 1 ]  
    ]
}

pcm.looprec {
    type dsnoop
    ipc_key 2049
    ipc_key_add_uid 0
    slave {
        pcm "hw:Loopback,1,0"
	period_time 0
        period_size 1024
        buffer_size 4096
        channels 2
    }
    bindings {
        0 0
        1 1
    }
}
```
I would like to add that #04 is appended onto the end of #02 but for brevity #02
is not included here. The thing that stands out here is that middle key block
where we have a plug and a multi plugin. Plug is actually a generic term for
any plugin and can be used to simplify nesting multiple keyblocks. Multi is where
the fun begins. We assign two channels to both a and b where a is our current source
dmixed and dmixerloop is a dmix wrapped loopback. specifically a sink loopback which
is signified by the first subdevice being a 0. (Loopback,"0",0) As loopback modules
are connected to one another by their second values.
```
Loopback,0,0 <-> Loopback,1,0
Loopback,0,1 <-> Loopback,1,1
Loopback,0,2 <-> Loopnack,1,2
```
So anything sent to either end with be broadcast to the other. what we do on the
multichannel is a one way broadcast. ie dmixed -> dmixerloop -> looprec
But thats just fine as looprec is a source and can be put into programs like obs
to record our audio or as a music visualizer. 

There is one more plugin that might be worth visiting if you have custom sound
controllers
```
pcm.softmixer {
    type softvol
    slave.pcm "out"
    control.name "PCM"
    control.card 1
}
```
Where you would change "PCM" to your specific hardware controller of your choice
allowing you the ability to change the volume for that paticular stream. This is
especially handy if you have multiple outputs you wish to tune the volumes of
differently.

# Bluetooth

Now as the one section with a title it's quite different. And very much optional
especially given that [bluez](https://github.com/bluez/bluez) has ended support for alsa officially in version
3.0.0. However a very dedicated person created a bridge called [bluez-alsa](https://github.com/Arkq/bluez-alsa).
Which allows you to still use bluetooth. The installations of which should be
fairly straightforward using your package manager. If your package in your
repository is out of date like mine was. You might need to compile it yourself.
However there is a very nice installation guide in the wiki for bluez-alsa.

The basic method they outline is to use this configuration where XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
is your bluetooth devicces mac address.
```
device "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"
profile "a2dp"
service "org.bluealsa"
ctl.device bluealsa
```
This is fine, if you don't mind no audio mixing. They also outlined a method to
use dmixer which makes use of this added piece of configuration
```
pcm.blueout {
    type plug
    slave {
        pcm {
            type dmix
            ipc_key 1026
            slave {
                pcm {
                    type hw
                    card "Loopback"
                    device 0
                    subdevice 1
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
With the command given here
alsaloop -C looprec -P bluealsa:DEV=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX,PROFILE=a2dp -c2 -fs16_le -t 20000

The system services you will end up needing are bluetoothd, bluezalsa and alsaloop.
The first two are simple, but the third you will need to create yourself as each time
you reconnect your device it will end the command unless a service manager reruns it.
I use runit, which has a very simple way of creating service files where I create a file
```
$ mkdir -p /etc/sv/alsaloop
$ vim /etc/sv/alsaloop/run

#!/bin/sh

exec >/var/log/alsaloop.log 2>&1

exec alsaloop -C looprec -P bluealsa:DEV=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX,PROFILE=a2dp -c2 -fs16_le -t 20000

ln -s /etc/sv/alsaloop /var/service
```
With that you should have a function bluetooth device. Now, I'm not quite
satisfied with that, so I made a couple scripts which I use in conjuction with
dwm to make switching between hardware and bluetooth easier.

Which you can find in my git repository [here](https://github.com/reluekiss/alsa-scripts/tree/main).
