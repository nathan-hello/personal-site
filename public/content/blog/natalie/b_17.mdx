In the eternal quest for knowledge acquisition people will inevitably be led to programming and computer engineering. Due to the large part it plays in so many of our lives. As a person broadly interested in mathematics, the concepts in computer science are very intriguing for their application of many of the concepts I find familiar. There are many interesting languages out there and many more functional ones but for it's predominance and teaching of core principals I landed on learning C. As a quick aside for those of a mathematical inclination the book [Structure and Interpretation of computer programs](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/) or colloquially, 'The wizard book' gives good reasoning for a lot of common programming practises that often go unsaid. Aside from it's ubiquity, I personally run quite a bit of software which is written in C and for my comprehension it would be very useful for me to learn more about it.

[This](https://github.com/reluekiss/C-learning.git) is where I am currently posting my attempts to the questions from the C programming book by Kernighan and Ritchie as well as some [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/) problems. Not all problems will be in a complete state or well commented, though for future I will endeavour to do so. For the benefit of myself and others.

In the last couple decades there have been a number of languages vying to take control of the spot of 'the main language in systems programming' with varying success. The current largest contenders, and forgive me for any I miss, are go, rust, zig and C++. All of these have varying degrees of implementation but also share different paradigms. With go and zig being more similar to C in their simplicity. Though it is rust and C++ with more credit, the former having support added to the Linux kernel which is the premier bed for systems programming and C++ being the foremost used in video games. That second point may seem odd in a discussion in systems programming. However, it is an industry with a very large impact on common practises in programming.

However, even with all these new contenders C still remains the language used by computers as well as between different programming languages as a de facto ABI even with all of it's [problems](https://thephd.dev/to-save-c-we-must-save-abi-fixing-c-function-abi). 

Regardless of the 'politics' that surround the language it still teaches many of the core principals within computing with some parts such as manual memory management in the form of allocation and pointers being often removed in other languages for ease of use or to minimise problems that can arise from bad practises. As before mentioned, I use many programs written in C and as such interfacing with them and my system as a whole is encouraged when writing in C.

In any case, dear readers, I hope you all a very good morning, afternoon or evening. o/
