With the advent of networking we were suddenly able to send each other messages
via telegrams in digitised forms almost instantly, though the likelyhood you
were a part of a BBS network as they were called (were you connected to a large
mainframe). Where you had an account of your own, and could communicate(?) with
others. These rather primitive methods slowly gave way to optical telegrams
or 'terminals'. This whole series of events has quite an interesting recounting
by one Stephenson Neal in his book 'In the beginning was the command line'. I 
won't link to it as it's a text file and one can find it quite easily.

But with the advent of these bbs networks, came the creation of the first IRC
servers. Internet relay chat or IRC as I shall now refer to it, is a 
standardised federated instant messagin service with only enough bandwidth to
support text. I would argue that the advent of anyhting additional could be 
made up with ftp and dcc just fine, but alas. 

The IRC of today looks a little different today then it did 40 years ago. With
quite a few nicities that only the most staunch networks don't follow, namely
bouncers, ssl/tls/sasl and cloaks, the first is a proxy by which one can stay
continually connected to a server without missing any of the messages the
people in the channels you wish to read are talking about. Though these days 
it is also possible to implement sql databses to keep track of conversations
that is by no means the norm. The second actually allows for encrypted
connections and my server only allows ssl/tls connections. For the security
of everyone connected, as any one person not using it will be transmitting 
all messages unencrypted. (You needn't worry though as it's simply a
toggalable option on most modern irc clients). Finally cloaks allow your ip
to stay hidden to anyone else inside the server apart from the hosting server.

I could drone on about the multitude of clients forever, but the following
[guide](https://landchad.net/irc/) is very informative on setting up your own clients and even servers if
you were so inclined.

Honestly it's a great protocol, and I would recommend everyone try it, the
little bit of reading and application does everyone's brains some good. But for
those interested our server can be found at tv.reluekiss.com:6697 (we might buy a
new subdomain for it, but we really have no need).
