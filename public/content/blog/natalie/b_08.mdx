I was looking through some stuff and found an interesting resource, there was an
[article](https://github.com/a327ex/blog/issues/44) I read in which the following image
was in and it shows an interesting breakdown of linux usage by country, in summary most
were about 10% with some interesting stand out countries.

## Japan & PRC

These twp seem like an interesting case of linux adoption in the PC market, on the one
hand (in my limited view at least) they both seem stereotypicaly quite technologically
futuristic (Japan on this one mainly). However their adoption of Linux usage seems to be
fairly limited. I can posit a couple reasons for this:

- The culture to conform is too deeply ingrained in the society and as such it would be
  odd to create a _personalised_ desktop enviroment for one's own use.
- The other is that they both seem to use mobile devices or ASIC's (consoles, in the case
  of games) more frequently. Then in the other countries.
- Typing using glyph type systems is not really as supported, there do exist projects on
  linux such as mozc which do bring great support for these languages, however due to a
  lack of support in lofts of gui software (mostly games), its not as viable.

## USA

Which brings me onto the next strange country, whhich seems to only have half the rate of
linux users of other developed countries. As linux was developed with english in mind it's
interesting that adoption is not as common as in other places.
