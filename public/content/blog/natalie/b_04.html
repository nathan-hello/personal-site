<div class="">
  If you have looked around any ricing/unixporn esque forums you will likely have
  encountered someone's fetch or other utility that is showing their favrouite anime girl.
  <br />
  As great of a technology as this is, it remains fundamentally a hack, this isn't a negative
  in in of itself however it makes portability, and the maintaining of such projects that incorporate
  these really difficult. Currently there seems to be an implementation done by every major
  terminal emulator, such as kitty or alacritty. The original implementation, namely uberzug
  (now reimplemented as ueberzupp) uses a daemon to create an X window confined to the terminal,
  rather than paticular escape sequences. However it seems as if this is no longer the default
  option, though in my opinion, it's the best, purely because none of these implementations
  work in plain tty and as such doing away with it as it 'requires you to be in a X' to function
  is here nor there. The fact that it also supports gifs just makes it all in all the best,
  aside from the slightly higher resource usage.
  <br />
  I've made some scripts myself that make use of this, such as displaying coverart of music
  playing in ncmpcpp. And I will say that it's much more unwieldy to use ueberzug in place
  of alternatives. But for my aformentioned reasons I still continue to use it.
