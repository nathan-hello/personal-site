Opinions on phones these days feels like dream recountings. I will simply never care why someone prefers
android vs ios. There is nothing anyone will ever say that would surprise me. Oh you like FaceTiming your
dog? Wow… Oh you want to be able to make your homescreen look like the result of my 7th grade html class? Very cool!


I used to know a whole lot about phones. Every release from every major manufacturer, I would watch the
MKBHD video, the LTT video if they did one, and I would brag to myself (I think this is called pride) that
I could recognize any phone by its rear face. It wasn't that hard a few years ago because there was less
smartphones in use then. I think because post-2017 phones are actually good with decent cpus that means
that there are more phones in circulation. 


This is to say that I really enjoyed knowing about smartphones. I don't enjoy consumer electronics content
as much anymore. Knowing things is not a hobby, much less if the subject knowledge only exists to answer
the question “What X should I buy?”. Headphone nerds you're on watch too, by the way. Y'all only get away
with it because to know about headphones you have to know about audio and to know about audio you need
to know some kind of cool physics, electronics, and (probably minor) biology.  

Since 2018, I've been whole hog into iOS. I don't care about the ecosystem. My iCloud has been broken since
2021 because it says “not enough storage to backup” regardless of how little I ask it to back up. In fact
I don't think the ecosystem exists. I have a couple categories of apple ecosystem features:
- a gimmick (Universal Clipboard) 
- something that exists just because apple restricts any other way of doing it (Sidecar)
- something that should be an open standard, or use an open standard that already exists (AirDrop, iMessage/FaceTime, Health data)
- something that is made completely obsolete by just using the filesystem (everything iCloud, AirDrop)


I also have the watch, which to be fair has some kind of argument for being a good ecosystem moment. When
I set an alarm or get a notification, my watch vibrates in tandem. This is a big deal to me because I snooze
a lot and I don't like torturing my beautiful wife from her much needed rest. This is the only ecosystem
feature that gives me pause for ditching my iPhone. Are there good watches that pair to androids? I remember
LTT's Linus would wear an apple watch without an iPhone in protest because although he hates, iPhones he
hated the fact that there wasn't an equivalent watch for android. 


The reason I'm taking pause and looking left and right for a reason to switch to android is because of
my newfound resentment for non-free software. It's really, really bad actually.


I'm an AV integration software developer by trade. This means I'm working with devices like microphones,
cameras, displays, video matrix switchers, a bunch of random stuff from random manufacturers, some you
have heard of and some you haven't. Each of these devices typically have an ascii protocol to talk to it
and that's fine. Every manufacturer will make a different protocol for the various commands you can give
it, and that's fine too. Standardizing the commands you can give to devices would be like standardizing
the food given to animals at the zoo. And some of them are tricky, sometimes there are variables you have
to embed within a command, typically just an identifier like `0x41` (ascii for 1), but other times it'
 a bit worse like having a BCC where you XOR every byte in the message bytes, but not the header bytes
because those are always the same and not the footer bytes because that's where the BCC goes! Like okay
 sure, but with one device there wasn't even an ID which means that every possible command and its corresponding
BCC is known ahead of time, so why not just include it in your docs? 


Anyways, people have noticed this problem and make libraries for talking to devices. In this instance,
there is a proprietary programming ecosystem (Crestron's Simpl Windows/+/#). The language itself is proprietary
and written 25 years ago, but that's why they have Simpl# which is “just” a C# library. And what you might
do is use that C# library and compile it for use in Simpl Windows for the ~~worse~~ more traditional AV
programmers. The problem is, when people ship this they only distribute the compiled C#, no source. 


This means that after a certain point, it's locked and you can't look into the library you're using. Reminder
the only thing this library is doing is building a string. 


This was a nexus event because I am sitting there, on site, with the customer hovering over my shoulder
as I'm trying to get a device to be sent the correct string command from the processor, and it just won't
send. I go into the module, goto definition a couple times, pull out a handy ctrl+f, and bam! Compiled
C# library, do not pass go, do not collect $200. I'm sitting there dumbfounded why the function call isn't
doing what I'm expecting and I have to sit there and say “I don't know and they won't tell me”. It was
kind of humiliating, like I'm the horrible programmer that introduced a mismatched state condition that
makes the function not work. Maybe they pessimistically made it to not send unless some other condition
is met? (I love OOP by the way) 


I resolved it by grabbing the API docs and sending the string myself. This begs the question why was I
using a library if the solution was so simple, but this is a post about phones!


I want to goto definition until I am at the top of the tree. This obviously doesn't apply to operating systems
as much because you have to be using the post-compiled version, but it still stands. I will never understand
the inner workings of the linux kernel or much of the coreutils to have this aspiration pay off. But by
golly it is worth pursuing! 


Android is a soup of poor technical decisions (JVM) made 15 years ago and a dozen manufacturers gluing
their proprietary nonsense on top. It is not an open source platform and it infuriates me when people think
it is. If you're using any major vendor, it is just as closed as iOS. And good luck disabling google play
services. It's just not tenable. If Google had GPL'd Android way back when we would be living in the space
age by now, but in our reality it is just horrible. 


Spotify and YouTube's APKs are closed, I get that and I'm not against it. It's a natural tension of commercial
interests vs free software. But the OS being as technically and spiritually corrupted as it is, it's just
not an option for the serious person using their phone for serious work. 


I want to be convinced that I'm wrong about android. I want to get a 10 year phone that runs
a properly open source operating system, even if its UX is a bit worse than iOS. And to be completely real
with you, I started this questioning phase when iOS 18 rolled out and completely nuked the Control Center
*[1]*. Everyone complains about iOS 18's Photos app, but the real victim is Control Center. A bastion of
system controls that should be replicated everywhere has now been neutered by apple's desire to appeal
to the worst and most annoying criticism Android users (not iOS users!!) have been making: the lack of
customization. 


I liked how iOS tells you to go fuck yourself when you want to make gaps in your home page. I liked how
custom app icons are up to the app developer to give out. I liked how control center was there to say 
“these are your system controls, changing audio source and wifi and such, and if you want some extra buttons
like booting up Shazam or a timer shortcut, you can put it there and no where else”. This consistency is
something to admire. It's a restriction that allows less neurons to fire when you need a simple task done
 Anyone use uses vim bindings in their editor will understand what this means in practice. The buttons
are there! Use it! If you want the button some place else, why? What value does this provide? It provides
none and the detriment of adding buttons for the sake of it is tangible. 


In my line of work, I set up a tablet for a user of the AV equipment to control the video/USB routing,
camera controls, things like that. Imagine you're a professor in a large auditorium and there are 6 displays
 What goes on them? What “mode” is the room in? What microphones are live? Some things we can assume with
the 90% use-case of the room and some things we need input from the user to dictate what to do. 


One of the most common requests frontend programmers will get is to add a button for X use case. Sure, you
can do some action with five buttons but could you collapse that into one button? Please, I promise I just
need a shortcut for the common use-case and there aren't others that I haven't considered. And it's a matter
of judgement if this is actually better. Much of my time in design is spent making the system intuitive.
Many times these systems will be used by someone who is using it for the first time, and over the course
of a decade, statistically, someone will use the system without being trained and without someone to help.
This means that buttons can't be scary. A button should not look as if it's if it could be a destructive
action without proper counterweights to prevent perceived destruction. Is there a modal that will pop up
to prevent me from breaking everything? And if so, do I know that beforehand? This is mostly a solved problem
in the web world and I'm excited to bring these insights when I'm building custom software for a client
because they aren't used to it.


But sometimes, a frontend programmer has to say no, you're wrong and that the fact you have to do it my
way is important. The only one of these new iOS features I think is worthwhile is the fact that you can
take a photo as your lock screen and blur the background to a custom color. I use this feature to have
a picture of my beautiful wife holding a jar of pickles as my lock screen while omitting the fact it was
taken at Walmart. 


This opinion of mine extends to desktop, by the way. For consistency's sake I will specify that I don't
like how configurable linux is. I use dwm for my desktop environment (which means I don't really have
a DE, just a window manager), but only with much begrudging and using a slightly modified config.h by Natalie
The customization on linux for me is really just adding features that should exist, like having dwm show
the time with dwmblocks. If Windows had good UX like iOS does, I would be in this exact same dilemma but
thankfully it's shit all around so I don't have to write a blog post about it. 


I m asking for FOSS android options because I'm interested, though it's a little bad faith to say that I
want to switch. There is a list of features that I would require before switching that is probably not
feasible.


First apple doesn't track you like google play services does. One company is in the phone business and the other
is in the advertising business. Natalie and I go back and forth on this, and I will absolutely
admit that there is telemetry in iOS and perhaps some of it is personally identifiable. But with anything
that google touches, that's literally all they do. All of its data that is useful for its advertising business
will always be personally identifiable. How could it not? It is always cringe to compare giga tech giant
vs other giga tech giant like “my monopolistic company is better than yours!”, but in the issue of privacy
there just IS a winner. And you can't downgrade to a clamshell because the Chinese government is in the
telcom networks. There has to be some degree of trust in the current market. There is the option of only
giving your data to networks of open source or p2p softwares but that's like the transition from twitter
to blue sky. One is objectively better for the planet but it only works if the people you want to be on there, are. 


Second, there are just so many UX wins on iOS that have nothing to do with ecosystem. I don't ever have
to worry about drain. I don't have to worry about the 24gb of ram in my phone existing. I don't have to
worry about apps running in the background. In fact, I don't ever have to close apps from the switcher
thing. I'm sure this is a solved problem on android, but if so why do they require 6000mAh batteries to
get 1.5 days of life? Why do they require 16gb of ram? Why do qualcomm cpus lag behind apple's by 2-4 years?
Why, in 2017 with the release of the iPhone X, did android copy iOS's home bar in the worst way possible?
Why does nothing feel consistent? Does android have good password management yet? If so that's actually
a huge win but I switched to an S21 when it released and my lastpass had to do an popup to insert passwords.
As in, a modal like Facebook Messenger (another horrible UX disaster that people love for some reason).
On iOS, it's a feature of the keyboard. 


Oh, that reminds me, a few years ago apple conceded and allowed custom keyboards on the platform. Have
you ever seen someone use a non-default keyboard on iOS? No, because they are all just worse. There isn't 
any magic to it, there's no API that apple's has that the others don't. They are just worse hands down
and yet another example of customization just being a pursuit of openness with zero benefit. I get apple's 
attitude change, and I get why they want to give these little breadcrumbs so people tell their android
friends “actually we can customize stuff”. The problem is that it will always fall short because until
it's something significant, like what android calls the launcher, or the notification screen, core parts
of the frontend, it will always be less than on android and therefore fall flat to the imaginary person
who has a problem.


I haven't mentioned encrypted texting because of course there is RCS. But… oh, what's this? End to end
encryption isn't a part of the [RCS standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_Services#Encryption_support)? 
The thing that every other messaging client, even Facebook Messenger, has figured
out? I hate how the details don't matter anymore. The RCS discourse has concluded now that Apple supports
it (something they did begrudgingly, potentially because of the Chinese government, and way too late),
but while that was going on it was extremely annoying that the assumption was that it was as secure as
iMessage/WhatsApp/Signal. It does have TLS as a part of the spec, which is a start to prevent the Chinese
from reading those texts. Why can't the opposition get themselves together? Why can't OSS and standards
based solutions be as good as the closed ones? Oh no don't tell me that the root cause is actually competition
under capitalism…


Thanks for reading, this post was brought to you by a five hour flight in the middle seat by the worst
airline I have ever flown. Natalie, I love you and I'll be home in an hour or two (though I will have to
post this after I get home… wait a second how to do I get this long of a note off of my phone and on my
computer… why doesn't iOS have a decent filesystem…)


[1] After writing this, I went to edit control center to get rid of the extra two pages they shipped by
default. One was for your connections and the other was for media. These provide zero value because there
is no difference between long pressing the wifi symbol to show that page, and the same for media. And it
is worse because with multiple pages, swiping down means you go to the next page instead of closing the
control center. Removing these erroneous pages brought back the close-by-swiping-up functionality that
I have 6 years of muscle memory for. With the pages, you have to tap the outer bounds of the control center
to close it. Just horrible. If I had thought to remove them before making this post I might not have made
it, so thanks apple for having a major UX flub that inspired this post.
