This website started with two goals:

&#8226;	Post content.

&#8226;	Allow Natalie to post content as easily as possible.

My beautiful wife isn't interested in webdev, and I don't want to force it on her.
We both want to post content, and I want to it to be easy for myself as well, so
the question is: what's the right balance between making the typical blog post
simple and out of the way, while maintaining the ability to reach out and make
more interactive experiences, should they arise?

Astro is pretty far left in this category. The framework has grown a lot since I started
using it (to include the [introduction](https://astro.build/blog/astro-db-deep-dive/) and eventual
[deprecation](https://astro.build/blog/goodbye-astro-studio/) of AstroDB), and it is extensible
because it is purposefully not a frontend framework, but a backend one. You can bring your own
frontend framework and allow Astro to serve the static assets and pull in dynamic data via React
or just normal JS or whatever.

There's a critical flaw with Astro - the `.astro` file. It's the thing that you look at first and say
"what the heck how would anyone find this acceptable?", then in the middle of the bell curve you think
"oh, it's actually pretty great because you can colocate your JS and markup kinda like JSX but as a
backend framework", and then after a while you want to write your website using anything but the one
editor it works on and you run into wall after wall of either the LSP or the Treesitter not working. 

I installed VSC*de on my home machine only because writing Astro was so atrocious on neovim. I don't like
tech that dictates what my editing experience is, and for Natalie that's a non-starter. She will rather go
without any of the dev tools then go down the web dev rabbit hole. Natalie has this idea of a semi-interactive
story-telling thing (I'll let her break ground on that because it's really cool) and when she described it to
me I just knew it wasn't something that we were equipped to do. And I don't want to pour more time into Astro
when I could do it right and set ourselves up for success. No more happy paths, but instead our own path.

So, a few months ago, The Big Rewrite was underway. I went through a few iterations of what content creation
would look like, but I'll spare the details. For us, the blogs are the same. We write in a markdown(x) file in a folder,
give some metadata details in the frontmatter, and the program spits out all of the html statically at "build" time.

Build time in what I'm uncreatively dubbing `nat-ssg` (library soon?), is just program initialization. Basically
the idea is that all of the data that *can* be pre-rendered SSG style will be pre-rendered. As in, there is a static
folder `/var/www/reluekiss.com/public/` which the nginx server reads from. Whenever there a browser requests a route
that matches a file/filepath in that folder, we just serve the file.

I aboslutely love how we ended up actually rendering the files. There's three ways right now:

&#8226;	 Write html and put it in `pages/`

&#8226;	 Write a blog post and put it in `public/content/blog/` (I'm very careful with my filepaths)

&#8226;	 Write a templ component and manually put the url in the `main.go`


Blog basically works the same it did in Astro, only that I've unrooted much of what Astro did for us. We use 
`gomarkdown` as all good Go web apps do, but we still have some heavy lifting to do. We never really liked
how code blocks worked on the website. We couldn't figure out how to customize it on the server to have a nice
font, have lines on the left, make it centered, you get it. I think when we looked into it all we could find
were frontend JS things, and [we're very cautious of frontend JS](https://reluekiss.com/notices). In Go, however,
we get some handy hooks to let us inject whatever we'd like when `gomarkdown`'s AST hits a code block.

Basically, it makes the AST, then as it renders it checks if that node (code block, paragraph, bold text, etc)
has some non-default function it should use instead. Here's what it looks like in action:

```go
package render

import (
	"io"

	"github.com/gomarkdown/markdown"
	"github.com/gomarkdown/markdown/ast"
	mdhtml "github.com/gomarkdown/markdown/html"
	"github.com/gomarkdown/markdown/parser"
)

func MarkdownRender(md []byte) []byte {
	extensions := parser.CommonExtensions | parser.AutoHeadingIDs | parser.NoEmptyLineBeforeBlock | parser.MathJax 
	p := parser.NewWithExtensions(extensions)
	doc := p.Parse(md)
	opts := mdhtml.RendererOptions{
		Flags:          mdhtml.CommonFlags,
		RenderNodeHook: mdRenderHooks,
	}
	renderer := mdhtml.NewRenderer(opts)
	return markdown.Render(doc, renderer)
}

func mdRenderHooks(w io.Writer, node ast.Node, entering bool) (ast.WalkStatus, bool) {
	if code, ok := node.(*ast.CodeBlock); ok { // Are we in a CodeBlock?
                // Sweet. Let's grab out the language (code.Info) and the code (code.Literal) and give it to our rendering function
		high, err := CodeHighlighter(string(code.Info), string(code.Literal)) 
		if err != nil {
                        // If it errors out, that's ok! Just write out the original, it's not that deep. We'll catch it.
			w.Write(code.Literal)
		}
                // Write the newly formatted code please!
		w.Write([]byte(high))
                // Tell the AST that we're good to go. No idea what the `true` is for.
		return ast.GoToNext, true
	}
        // I didn't like how paragraphs were in the default rendering so I just make it a <br/>
	if v, ok := node.(*ast.Paragraph); ok {
                if v.Parent != nil { // Except if the paragraph is the first one.. that would look weird.
		w.Write([]byte("<br/>"))
                }
		return ast.GoToNext, true
	}
	return ast.GoToNext, false
}
```


I absolutely love how this turned out because I can actually dig into the renderer and change stuff I don't like. That's
what you get when you step out of highly opinionated frameworks and do some Real Programming. No shots on those who like
their frameworks. For work I've been developing on a React + Vite app, using a ton of shadcn and v0. It's nice when what
you're making is the happy path and you don't need to do hacks. But there's a difference between a touchscreen that just
needs to look pretty and be written somewhat efficiently and a labor of love which is this website. There are tons of these
little moments through the rewrite and you can dig through it. It's only about 2500 lines of the Gopher's language.

Next, I want to show you how I did Components. This is what makes this a proper SSG framework, and will allow Natalie to
dream big. 

First, quick note on [templ](https://github.com/a-h/templ). I abosolutely love this library, I absolutely love the maintainer
who gave [this excellent talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkK8Jxjj95s) that helped me understand not just how LSPs work,
but why they *have* to work that way and the real-world nitty-gritty of getting something done. His explanation here is something
I strive for whenever I'm explaining something technical to other technical people. 

The library, as I talked about [here](https://reluekiss.com/nathan/p/100026) is a breath of fresh air not just to Go, but of
the concept of server-side rendering HTML without server-side Javascript. No other HTML templating library can say with a straight
face that they use a Component model. That is, a function which returns HTML which itself can call other HTML rendering functions.
For some reason, these templating libraries expect that you're writing one HTML file per route! Yes, you can have headers and footers,
(as Astro and now `nat-ssg` calls them: Layouts), but you cannot have an arbitrary piece of HTML encapuslate all of the child HTML that
it may need if you actually need to call code to render it. That sounds like a mouthfull, but if you've been trying and failing as hard 
as I have to hate React, it's the thing that I want to shout at the rooftops. Components! Why after a decade of React's dominance in webdev
have templating engines not tried this yet? Have you seen jinja? Have you seen `template/html`? It's absolute insane people who don't
build interactive experiences on the web trying to make an API for building websites. You get bumpkis and that's why server-side JS is
so prevalent. It's impossible to write a good webapp without Typescript. Oh, did I mention that `templ` is typesafe and has an LSP?
And don't worry about [injection attacks](https://templ.guide/security/injection-attacks/) because there is no shot you're going to get 
html in a component without running `templ.Raw()` (which is something that React does by default and it's GOOD).
I am absolutely jazzed to see native having good DX. It's a rare sight, and I haven't built anything interactive with it so maybe I'm
missing something big but if you're okay with your Typescript being in a different file, I don't expect there to be anything to complain about.

We use Templ to build components, that's its whole job right? Well excuse me because I wasn't clear. These `nat-ssg` Components are called *inside*
of the html, then parsed + rendered during the "build" process. It'll be clear with an example so here is our entire `index.html`:

```html
<!-- pages/index.html -->
<!--
<ascii>
 _   _       _       __   
| \ | |     | |     / /   
|  \| | __ _| |_   / /__  
| . ` |/ _` | __| / / _ \ 
| |\  | (_| | |_ / /  __/ 
|_| \_|\__,_|\__/_/ \___| "We are Boingus"
</ascii>
<title>Nat/e</title>
<description>We are boingus.</description>
-->
<div class="ml-[10%] mr-[10%]">
        <ManyPostMini amount="all" author="all" sort="descending"></ManyPostMini>
</div>
```

First, beacuse of the templ's model, I put everything in a Layout. For the `index.html`, that's `layouts/Base.templ` and everything inside of
`index.html` goes inside of `{ children... }` of that layout.

Now that we have a decent start to the page, let's bring in the content. `<ManyPostMini>` is a Component. It's defined in `render/components.go`,
right alongside that `CodeHighlighter` from earlier (we reused the codeblocks for the markdown as a Component, how cool is that!). Now, every component
gets a struct, so here's what we need to get going:

```go
type ComponentFunc func(component) (templ.Component, error)

func registeredComponents() map[string]ComponentFunc {
	return map[string]ComponentFunc{
		"Code":         code,
		"ManyPostMini": manyPostMini,
	}
}

type component struct {
	Element    string
	Attributes map[string]string
	Children   string // any nested components are already html by the time their parent gets rendered
}
```

First we need which Component we called in the html, that's `Element`, then we get the Attributes as a `map[string]string`, and we also need to tell
Templ where to put its children because oh snap! It's all Templ components the whole way down! Because know what Component (again, `Element`) we're 
trying to render, we can start writing functions that parse out those attributes, get the data we need, place the children where they should go,
and return a `templ.Component` to then be rendered during the "build" process. All of this was so tricky to get right which was the cause for a big
delay in the rewrite, but now that it's here it's so clear that this is how I want to write this website. Natalie can ask me for a feature request
on some Component that she would want that requires some third-party data, something from the filesystem, whatever, and I can provide her the data
she needs to do what she really wants to do, which is just write html and forget about the rest. And for my sake, I can write a new page with not
much overhead. And of the overhead I do need, I can make it into a Component!

I think this is an excellent strategy if you're looking for a good balance between what you write in your static html and dynamic data. 

Most of the rest of the rewrite was spent trying to get this portion to work. 

Notable mentions include: 

&#8226;	 failed attempt in squeezing all of our blogs that are on the filesystem into SQLite things asdf

&#8226;	 XML parsing from HTML comments to get page metadata so I don't have to bake that in to the Go/Templ side

&#8226;	 ChatGPT for writing the HTML parsing for Components

&#8226;	 Natalie for doing really cool ascii art

&#8226;	 HTMX for powering out comment sections (we don't do telemetry, so please leave one!)

&#8226;	 `io.Writer` for being such an excellect 10/10 5 star programming moment


Thanks for reading :)
