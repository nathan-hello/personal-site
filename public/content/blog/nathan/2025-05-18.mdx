A few months ago I posed the idea to Natalie on getting an FM radio license. We didn't talk much about it,
as if we were in such agreement that neither bothered to ask any details - and given the number of excuses I've been
handing out to friends and family over the last few months, it remains an idle curiousity. 

We play public domain/open license music. Podcasts and talks from yesteryear about our favorite topics.
As hosts, we could have recurring bits of proper old school radio delight, minus the cheesy sound effects. We would have
control on sponsorship, if any at all. I assume that an FM license is cheap to obtain and cheaper to maintain, but maybe this
is a bad assumption (bands are scarce!). Anyways, it's been a little less than idle lately. I'll find myself dreaming
of fostering a community of like-minded technologists, talking with Natalie the way we normally already would, but broadcasted.
A recording? NO! You either catch it live or you miss it. And as for who is actually listening at any given moment: that's the
beautiful thing about radio! You have absolutely no idea. You can have signals, like surveys and other call to actions, but you
will never know a minute to minute accounting of how much folks are listening to you right now. It's freeing because
there isn't a chat, no count, no feedback at all that what you're saying is worthwhile. I imagine it like a silent auction:
either put in your best offer or bust.

### But unfortunately, I don't listen to radio.

Why on earth would I step into a medium of which I am not just unfamiliar, but totally uninterested? I couldn't tell you
the last time I listened to the radio, on purpose, for more than 10 minutes. Every time I tune in, I get hopeful because I
rediscover the fact that radio actually does have nice variety. But, no matter how great it is I don't come back because my phone
is just technically better. I want to like radio, because they have DJs! Real humans that talk throughout their time on set. But,
I think radio has lost this edge, even to the soulless algorithm.
I'm a pop girly, and of course those are the worst offenders with the sound effects and staged call-ins, top 10 
songs that get replayed to accomodate for the average American's ~30 minute commute, and weaved between ads and segments, 
weather and traffic reports! But even of the stations that aren't as cringeworthy, no matter what they will still have advertisements 
and that's an absolute no-go for me. I pay for my music so I don't hear ads. I want to like radio, but the environment makes it impossible. 
And, if I'm not a radio listener, why should I be a radio broadcaster?

We have this blog, and honestly I don't keep track of anyone else's blogs. I never really understood RSS until Natalie showed 
me her preffered reader, and even now I struggle to muster the attention span to browse through blogs whenever I come across them.
I excuse my lack of interest in the blog space for one simple reason: this blog is on our turf.
This blog doesn't exist on a platform which our posts will algorithm towards you, there aren't links to it on billboards,
and we have not yet deployed the worm which changes your homepage to reluekiss.com.

I just find it weird when someone tells me they want to be an e-celeb, and often times it's through Twitch that they will find their fame.
And when I ask them what people they watch on Twitch, they don't seem that interested in the community. Small medium or large creators, not only
can they not name the personalities of the genre they're entering, they're uninterested. They see streaming as something they're
doing unto the world in a vaccuum. Sure there are other streamers, but they are the competition. I once knew someone who was
so serious in this venture that he would come into work and talk about his gang of 10 discord friends and what strategies they
had come up with, how his "progress" (as if it's 1-dimensional) is going, etc. One day he drops the hot knowledge to not stream
the hottest, newest game, but instead to stream a game that has a moderate amount of viewership. In fact, a new release getting
a lot of traction is good for you, because you can then go to some moderate or large category and 'steal' the that-game-only viewers.

While I expect every bit of this to be true, it forgets the reason why you probably wanted to stream in the first place: because
you like it! I enjoy streaming my programming from time to time. I enjoy it a lot, but after about two hours is
when the constant monologuing goes from fun to draining. I'm sure
this is a muscle I could exercise if I were to stick to it once a week for some months, but the point is that I only ever streamed
because I felt like talking in front of a mic. I enjoyed streaming, and I think I would enjoy it as a viewer, although it's hard to
watch programming streams because there's so much context necessary to enjoy a programming stream. For some reason no one does 2-3 hour
self-contained programming streams as well as Tsoding does. 

### Self-Viewership Rule:

> One must be personally interested in the content they produce such that they would consume their own content if they were not the producer.

One glaring hole that I find is what version of myself am I targetting? If I were evil and wanted to make Cocomelon 2: The Rise of Roblox, 
I could tell myself that it's awesome because four year-old Nate would have absolutely loved that movie. If I make an interesting
tutorial on how to do modern web development on Crestron touchpanels without having a C# backend, a Nate from 6 months ago would love that video,
but a Nate from 3 months ago wouldn't have much interest in the subject. It's just a bit convoluted with technical education because you can kinda just
imagine an arbitrarily junior dev and say "that was literally me at X months/years ago"... because of course you were at some point maximally
junior, compared to where you are now.

So, it would seem that the Rule kind of devolves into "Only produce content that you like". But maybe the Rule is more of
a way to get yourself to remove your own biases towards yourself. As in, the Rule turns into "Evaluate your content on its merits whether it is good or not". 
This way, the "Imagine yourself as the consumer of the content" is just a framing to get yourself to try to elimate some biases. I think it's more of
a grounding technique than it is a hard and fast Rule. Surely people write, act, edit, or otherwise produce content that they don't personally find enjoyable.
Is that really a crime? Would YouTube be better off if people only did things that they were personally interested in? On Twitch this question is a bit
harder to ask because anyone who is in it for more than 6 months does it for the love of the game. 

The opposite of the Rule would be "I know this content is not good enough for me, but it's good enough for the rest of the audience". Ignoring the Rule is
egotistical because you value their time less than your own, and weird because you know that you're producing slop. I like to believe the tech slop people just 
don't know any better. They are the casual reddit andies who have heard of segfaults and tabs vs spaces, but when they say tech enthusiast, they really just mean
average gamer. Yes I'm gatekeeping, and I think it's high time. I have nothing against the normies, even the PC gamer normies who shout PCMR because of the 'freedom'
a PC gives you over a Playstation, but still chooses to keep Windows with the OEM bloatware Corsair pre-installed for you. Those guys are fine, because they're harmless.
There's no world in which they start issuing bad pull requests or showing up with their opinions on dev twitter because the only software they can comprehend
creating themselves is in the programming language Unity. 

The Rule definitely has a 'there' there, but you can also imagine an audience. I think book writers get the advice "Don't write for everybody, write to somebody".
That phrase also is just trying to eliminate your biases when looking at a piece.


I love creating and I'm not going to stop any time soon. Every week I think about the youtube videos that I would enjoy making, every so often I think about a new blog post,
and one day I still hope to operate a radio station with my beautiful wife. If we don't get our license, maybe we just have [https://reluekiss.com/radio](https://reluekiss.com/radio)
