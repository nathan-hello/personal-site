Hey sweetie, you're on the way here and I am very excited.

I hope you had a safe flight. I'm sitting in the international arrivals section of the airport
with a ton of lovely people cheering on their loved ones as they finally see them go through the big double doors.

Airports are work, no one would ever want to hang out here, but we show up here anyways.
We're looking forward to seeing our family, coworkers, and not for the $6 bag of chips.
How could it be anything else? Of course they have to be designed for brutal efficiency (though not land efficient). 
They try to makr the stay here acceptable, but no matter what it's going to be work (especially for the traveller) 

Airports are diverse. Every group of people use them and that's apparent no where more than the international arrivals section.
Every time I'm at the airport I am reminded that there is a very large number of people who use them every day whether I'm thinking about airports or not.

The screen tells me your flight is going through customs, and my eyes are wide open waiting for you to walk through the double doors.

I love you sweetie, I hope your stay here becomes to what we've imagined it to be.
