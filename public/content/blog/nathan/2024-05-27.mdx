This is a really long blog post about me learning web stuff in Go. If you're not also learning web stuff in Go,
this probably isn't going to be interesting. If you are though, please leave a comment. :)

Once again, I wanted to make a simple document and I turned it into a blog post. This was meant to be a message in
the readme of [bear-hub](https://github.com/nathan-hello/bear-hub/), but it got too long and I don't think a readme
is the right place for a story, so I'm going to finish writing it here. 

Also, if you're looking for the website in question, it's not hosted yet. I'll put in instructions in the readme
to run the server/develop it yourself if you'd like. In the future I'm going to put it on something like 
bear-hub.reluekiss.com.

Doing this made me think "what was the other post that I rambled so hard I turned it into a blog post?" and it was
the post where I [wanted to start making videos](https://www.reluekiss.com/nathan/p/100017). Going through my posts,
I saw my [Abstractions Essay](https://www.reluekiss.com/nathan/p/100006), which is about this exact project!
I totally forgot I wrote that, so rereading it was a treat.
Let's compare four months later, six months into the project. I've learned a whole lot and have basically been doing
this one thing the whole time. I'm okay with putting this much time into one project because I'm learning! And it's
still interesting! And hopefully I can reuse the code for a potential rewrite of this very website! Even if all of the
text of the code goes in the garbage, the logic and what's necessary to do a proper website is something I have absolutely
loved exploring.

### Six Month Retrospective

When I made bear-hub, originally called no-magic-stack, I wrote a list of goals. A roadmap. A list of things to aspire
to. Well, after I made it I basically never looked at it again except to update what the project was doing and how to
set it up. I'm going to rewrite the readme to be what it is in its current state and point
to this post if anyone wants more insight to the history of the project (this will 100% just be for myself in the future,
no-user-gang rise up). I feel like this project stuck to those goals very closely, actually which is nice. But, 
goals should only be written down if you actually care about revisiting them to make sure you don't go off course.

#### Auth is Hard, Websockets are Easy, Postgres is Mid

Auth has been such a pain point. Now I have the JWT claims passing through the middlewares `r.Context()` correctly, so
I'm basically done except for all of the annoying parts. First there's password resets, but then I want to do fancy
stuff like TOTP 2fa tokens, and after that oauth/passkeys, and then after that become an oauth provider. I think doing
that is the final boss. Maybe API keys after that? But that's relatively harmless. I'm looking for ways to abstract
the auth package to the most reasonable degree. I want it to be as easy as the Auth.js/auth0 people, more on that later. 
I absolutely hate how many articles and tutorials
there are online of software that does not pass the "am I, the author, willing to put this into a production service" 
test. In with auth there should not be handwaves for this material. Either it's
golden or it's unusable, so tutorials that say "well in the real world you wouldn't *actually* want to do this" makes their content useless.

Once I got up and running with htmx's websocket extension, and some copypasta'd chatbot gorilla/websocket handlers,
it was off to the races. Mostly everything since then has been frontend stuff. I originally had an issue with 
[getting the form data to the server](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77953521/htmx-websocket-extension-not-sending-form-data-in-message-to-server)
which took a couple days to figure out but after that I was smooth sailing. Recently, I made the chat interface look
pretty because I thought that it wouldn't be very encouraging to work on something that visually looks like dogwater
even if it's technically interesting. Eventually I'm going to have to figure out content moderation, which is more
complicated than the current htmx websocket setup. Right now all it does is takes the div from the response and the
response is an hx-swap-oob, so it just puts it in the dom. Say a moderator bans a user and deletes all of their
chat messages. How does the client know to swap their messages with a "user has been banned" type of message? I 
think this requires some client-side js that I don't have yet.

Postgres was a big pain point. I wanted to make it work so much, and it does work! Use it! Leverage your database
to do work that is too annoying to do in the application. Want to auto generate a uuid? Easy! Want to do migrations?
Supabase has a really great migration situation that I'm starting to miss already. I moved off of Postgres because I don't want the database to do work
for me. Supabase prides itself on It's Just Postgres, might as well benefit from them doing all of the hard parts. 
But that, to me, seems like I'm learning a platform instead of learning a technology. Plus,
with sqlite, it's super duper local. Supabase has local development in the form of servers that live on docker containers
that you can host on your machine, but I couldn't ever get it to [work without shutting off my internet](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/19645). 
Anyways, all of this to say that I'm happy with sqlite because I want to do the heavy lifting myself, and now I get to learn the fun of
hand-rolled migrations (or not, I haven't gotten that far yet. I hear there are good tools for this). 

#### Htmx makes Correct applications, Sqlc is insane, Templ will take over web dev in 3 years

What you'll hear online is that htmx makes it really easy to send html from the server and render it in the
correct place. This is true, but it's not the whole story. When you have state in your application, you have
to keep track of it somehow. What htmx really, really wants you to do is to move almost all of the logic to
the server instead of the client. Whenever the client wants a page, you make a new state given the cookies,
query params, headers, form submission fields, etc, and you render a new html document to send to them. 
Importantly, all of the things I just listed are browser/http primitives that are here to stay. You leverage
what browsers do best so your server can do what it does best: work. Once I unlocked this idea of keeping
having a ClientState/AuthState struct, and being able to generate it based on what the client gave, it
really helped. You don't need to negotiate with the client of what it knows. It knows nothing. I saw someone
online say (paraphrasing) "A browser doesn't need to know how a calendar works. It only needs to know how
to render what the server gives it. The logic of the calendar is on the server, the representation of the
calendar - that's what goes to the client". And I agree with this so much. The fact that javascript has gotten
so good has been bad, because it means that the browser does more work than it was ever meant to. Stop making
calendars on the browser, that's not what they were made for. Keeping business logic away from the browser - that's what htmx is good at.

Contrary to what I just said, I've thought about doing some SPA-level stuff with htmx. The idea is instead of doing 
traditional routing where on a `GET /profile/yogibear61` request, the Go server responds with a fully complete html document, what really 
happens is I render, say, just the `<body>` and htmx hoists the response into the body. 
This way there's not a full page reload with a potential [flash of unstyled content](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Flash_of_unstyled_content).
The header, footer, etc, continues to exist, they aren't destroyed, it's just that the `<body>` tag gets
replaced. This I think would help make the page feel faster and whatnot, but I'm not sure how legal that is in my mind
yet. 

Quick note on something I said in my Abstractions Essay. Htmx does have some security implications, but only
if you have massive skill issues. You do have to think about sanitizing user input from html, because if you're
telling the browser "render this div", and that div contains a chat message that says `<script>alert("pwned")</script>`,
and it actually runs, yeah you have some security implications. Just sanitize your inputs, on our blog site we do this
with the comments and it's literally [one function](https://github.com/nathan-hello/personal-site/commit/fc066e0c1289f8febeedf27c03f07290f15e402d).

Sqlc is really, really good. Upon the transition from postgres to sqlite3, I tried to do the classic abstraction
thing where the application calls my db package, and that db package wraps both the sqlite3 and postgres
calls. The application doesn't know whether it's using postgres or sqlite3, it just gives the data to db,
and db figures out what to do with this. The problem otherwise is that postgres and sqlite3 have different types.
For example, postgres has a proper uuid type. This means that sqlc gives that field a `uuid.UUID` type. But sqlite3
does not have such a type, it only has `text`. So, my db package would wrap both of these calls and the application
would give whatever is most convenient (in this case, a `uuid.New()`) and db would disperse this information to
what's correct for the database. The problem with this is the synchronization and return types. Basically, the only
way to make it all work is if I made everything in postgres whatever sqlite3 can handle, and from which database
should I return? What if I was writing to them both at the same time? This issue is solvable, but as I was doing it
I realized it required an amount of effort that wasn't worth it. If you're curious, you can go
[here](https://github.com/nathan-hello/bear-hub/tree/sqlc-shananigans)
to figure out how I was trying to crack this egg. It is not pretty, but you're going to be looking in `src/db`

Templ is such an insane bit. The tooling and compilation has only gotten better since I started using it. I have
[one merged documentation PR](https://github.com/a-h/templ/pull/367) and another PR which I won't link that is a
rewrite of a static site generator someone wrote for [templ.guide](https://templ.guide). I absolutely love the project. 
It brings React's functional component model
to Go. That's it, that's all you need to know. If you've ever tried to use Python's Jinja or Go's tmpl for html templating,
it's an insane breath of fresh air. You literally pass Go structs, slices, whatever you want and as long as it goes
into a string before it gets rendered, you're golden. The PR I linked was documentation on how to get tailwind's LSP, html's LSP, htmx's LSP,
and templ's LSP all working within Neovim in .templ files. 
The fact that that works is insane, and it's getting better and better. Templ doesn't have Hooks, or RSCs,
or any other real React primitives, so comparing the two is a little bit disingenuous. It's not a React replacement,
it's an html templating replacement. If you're someone who uses React for html templating, you are just simply doing
it wrong. There's no need to bring in all of React for this job, and that's why templ and htmx work so well together.
You have the templating you need, and the htmx to do the client side shenanigans. State? Like I said before, the client
holds no state other than the tools that are built into http. useEffect? Wake up darli... what are you saying? 
Rendering lifecycles? Hydration errors? Do you know what year this is? You're speaking nonsense.

#### Abstractions are hard

Like I mentioned before, I want to make a package for auth in Go web apps. But it's not easy. If you look throughout
the code that calls on the stuff from `src/auth`, it's not as simple as taking on auth from on high. For example, I have it
so the SignUp/SignIn struct has a method of signature `RenderErrs() []string` so when I'm rendering the html, I pass that
struct into the templ templating, and within the template if there is anything within any of the errors, it will show them
in little boxes on the page. If SignUp.UsernameErr exists, it will make the border color of the username box red. How could
you make that into a package if you didn't own or understand the contents of the struct? The jwt boilerplate I think is
production-ready, so that will probably be the first part in my auth series, but that one file alone probably isn't worth
installing. Just copy it! If you look at it and you think it's good, copy it now! I like it, and if you don't then
please cut an issue because I want to get a second opinion. One cool gimmick I'm going to pull with my auth series is that
when I feel comfortable enough to share it, I'm going to pay real cash-money to pay a web security professional to do a code
tour and pentest on my auth system. I want to get real insight on what I personally overlooked, and what common mistakes are. 
This step is important because the number one reason I hear online of why someone should never, ever roll their own auth is
because there are "so many" footguns you can find yourself in, you should really leave auth to people who dedicate their
entire company towards security. But, to me, if you own your auth, and it Just Works, then you have it forever. You can
microservice the heck out of it, and as long as you don't have severe skill issues, it will still Just Work. Auth is a concept,
so if you have it done correctly then it will Just Work forever. That is, unless passwords really become out of fashion
and you have to move to passkeys, but I'll have that covered to!

I'm more excited for this project that I was working on [playlist-powertools](https://github.com/nathan-hello/playlist-powertools),
a webapp that at least had a potential of having more than one user, and I was newer at programming then! Learning concepts
instead of frameworks has been a lot of fun. I do want to say, however, that the chat service is something I intend on making
a real thing that people use. The tagline: "A self-hostable twitch chat clone". I originally thought
of making the chat backend be an irc server, but translating between irc and http (which I would need to do to avoid using
a [javascript irc client](https://github.com/kiwiirc/irc-framework/)) seemed unnecessary. I'll see where that part of the
project goes.

Thanks for reading. I didn't want this to be my longest blog post yet, and here we are. I get really excited with this stuff
because now I have multiple avenues of motivation, and this website is one of them.
