I read (listened to) The Fourth Turning a few years ago and it is such a compelling narrative
that I wanted to believe it. It gives this
grandiose vision of American history. Basically, it says that society exists in one of four turnings
in a cycle: a high, an awakening, an unraveling, and a crisis. We move through each of these approximately
every 20 years, and at the time the book was written (1996), we were on the tail end of the unraveling, and
so the authors predicted a crisis turning was up next. They went as far as to try to predict some of the things
that might happen to usher a crisis. 

This isn't a book summary, again I listened to the audiobook like five years ago and I don't recall the
details. I just had a thought earlier that I'm not sure if the way we think about generations fits anymore,
if ever at all. I remember when I was in middle school, Vsauce did a video on generations and mentioned The Four
Turnings book. He clarified that it's not just criticized, it's also unverifyable. I remembered him mentioning
the book when I was on a big audiobook spree and actually listened to it. Again, it's mesmerizing. 
"We've been though worse, we've been through many crises, this one is not so different. 
Maybe we can also get through climate change."
It gives a sense of honor in the struggle. If these things are possible
to get through with the gumption of a generation, then well it's my turn. Every person goes through the Four Turnings
like seasons through the year. The GI Generation had to fight their wars, and that was the previous crisis 
(about 80 years ago!).

Before I get to my point, I just want to point out a couple big problems that I've had in my head since listening to it.
First, it's very America-centric. Maybe that's the point, but I also think if you want to make claims about human
nature and society wide trends, choosing a country which has only lived for three 80 year periods
is not a great place to start. Also, is there a particular perspective by which we're making these claims? Is this
about "the average person"? Is it fair to choose an oppressed class as the arbiter of what is a crisis? If you
choose the narrative that historians use for these things, you're not actually choosing anyone in within the
historical context. It's like how we write about kings and queens of feudal times, but most people didn't care
about any of that stuff. 

Five years after the book, 9/11 happened. Which by the America-centric view of the
book would most certainly count as the crisis catalyst. In their list of potential catalysts for a crisis era, they even
mention a terrorist attack on the homeland. Since then, it doesn't seem like the crisis is going to end anytime soon. 
We ended our wars with Iraq and Afghanistan. America right now is the closest thing to peacetime
as we can expect. But do you feel like we're in peacetime? Did leaving Afghanistan actually permiate throughout society?
Are we just used to wartime that it stopped mattering entirely except for if you have a personal connection to a 
wounded veteran? Or was the war effort in the later years so pitiful because we were just trying to prop up a government, 
instead of actually fighting? All this to say, if the crisis was started with 9/11 and the consequential (illegal and
unjustified) wars, why did ending them not result in ...anything? No one celebrated, no one cared, the media and the
Republican party just got an excuse to get some easy dunks on Biden, everyone moved on. 
Trump and the current Republican party sprung up during this 
20 year period - a new crisis. And unless 2024 is a blowout victory for Dems (it won't be), they will persist in our 
government causing havoc. And then there's dealing with the effects of climate change.

Someone's internet diet is much better tell of who they are than where they are from. Internet space replaced physical space
in this sense.
I used to think that the generational gap exists with people who remember times before the internet existed, and those who see
the internet as a natural fact of life. I'm very much in the latter. But, as more younger people have different internet habits
than anything I'm familiar with (see: using tiktok as a search engine), I'm realizing that someone's internet diet can vary so
much among all ages that it stops being a useful fact to look at. Yes, content on the internet skews towards younger people, 
but any more generalizations beyond that and you get into vibe based territory, especially for something like YouTube. 
Say age was a useful metric for determining someone's internet diet - couldn't you just ask them about it? Couldn't you get
their interests and habits from other things about their personality? In what circumstance would you use age to assume stuff
about someone and actually act on that assumption? You can't even mention technical literacy, because there are people of all
ages that aren't comfortable with technology. Maybe they know about their corner of technology - music creation or running a plex
server, but not how to forward a port on their router or the minutiae of Windows settings.

Generations can be a useful tool for tracking a cohort with things like homeownership, how often they change jobs, or their
average savings accounts. These are economic data points that are real, actual data points. Things we can measure, and generational
gaps might exist and we might use the framing to answer questions about the data. But I'm a bit tired of someone asking "Am I a
millenial or a Gen-Z?", or even worse, debating what the "cut-off" is of any given generation. The cut-off doesn't exist! What do
people think? Is there some authoritative body that makes these kinds of things? Who would make them? Why should we listen to them?
I think if someone asks this question, it says a lot about how they view information as a whole. I get not having a good grasp of
how something like this might work, but asking this question tells me that your critical thinking of new ideas is really, 
really shortsighted. 
What I really answer with is that different people come to different conclusions about the exact years, but let me pull up the wiki
for the general sense. I wish I could figure out some way to bait this conversation with an unsuspecting victim and socratic 
method my way into making them realize they don't just know nothing about how the concept of research on generations, 
but they have no idea how ideas work. And there's not much to it! Tracking people by generation
is mostly tabloid nonsense to get older people to freak out about younger people doing things differently, or to judge them for
their avocado toast. 

I think that's why Millenials aren't engaging in this as much with the judgemental discourse. They entered
the economy just before, during, or soon after the 2008 recession. They get that it's rough out there, and they remember the
"Me Me Me" Generation nonsense. I'm not against using these labels to describe cohorts - I'm saying that people 99% of the time
use the labels to draw vibe-based conclusions to the point where the concept shouldn't be taken seriously anymore. 
So few non-economic things in our society are delimited by age. And for the things that are, you still can't construct a grand narrative.
If you do, I'm immediately suspicious.

Here's an example:

IDEA: Boomers are greedy because they use their outsized influence by way of voting, lobbying, and capital allocation to not build
new housing. This causes an excess strain on younger people to pay more and more for rent, in a world where wages are not keeping
up with inflation.

I've heard this take a thousand times, but if you swap "Boomers" with "Homeowners", it makes more sense. Homeowners want to protect
their investment, and as long as housing is treated as an investment, it will be against their interests to build new housing. Woah!
We just swapped out a meaningless label for a useful one and didn't have to adhom at all. It's never about age! Sure, older people
have higher rates of homeownership, but focusing on the older people is a misdirection. It's never about age. 

Also, I've always been interested in the non-American aspect of this. Do all western countries use the same age brackets for these
things because of WW2? Did they just copy the Gen-X/Gen-Y/Gen-Z/Gen-A convention because of American researchers? Did they copy it
all? Do people in other countries use them just through the cultural osmosis of the internet? Do non-English speakers make these
categories? 

What if instead of generations being when people were born, we talk about it from when the enter adulthood? Someone who is older than
me, but lived with their parents longer and was particularly sheltered probably doesn't have the same cultural understanding of
their cohort. Maybe they relate to younger people being their growth in childhood was slowed. Entering the workforce or otherewise
adulthood is a much more meaningful year for thinking about this than when someone was born. 

People talk about pop culture from when
I was a kid, and I have no idea what they're talking about. You can't expect someone to be familiar with pop culture for every year 
after they turn a certain age. And if that's the case, then saying "Gen-Z nostalgia" is a nonsense phrase. 
You can have nostalgia for cultural moments that have passed! That's more than okay! It's just when people use the
generational labels, it is an absolute, otherwise you would use some other label. If you admit "yeah of course not every Gen-Z is going
to know this, in fact some Gen-Z's are going to be born after this cultural thing!" Then you're just using a funny label because you
can't think of a better one (or you want clicks from people debating whether something is or is not Gen-Z).

I do have a suspicion, that my hate of using generations as a lense to view society is more towards how people use it than the idea
itself. Maybe if I read the original two books on this, then I'll find out that there are more applications than just tracking
people of different generations throughout the economy. So, I think I'll read/listen to Generations (1992), and The Fourth Turning (1996),
both my Neil Howe and William Strauss and come back to it. I want to have some evidence that our current situation was destined, and
the conclusion is hopeful.
