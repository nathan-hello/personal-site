Dear Natalie,

Sometimes I'm annoyed at my own music habits. In 2021, I had a bit of a mission to actually get in to music. I'll make playlists,
curate them to ever which mood that I listen to music in, I'll track those habits and change my playlists accordingly. At the peak,
I was managing probably 15 or so playlists. I had around 40, but a lot of them were seeds I was planting that never saw the light of
day, or playlists that I had just for statistics. Sorting the songs is something that I prided myself
in. When I turn on Spotify, I'm reaching for something. I found all of the things I reached for and made a playlist for it. 

But I got a bit carried away. It became a massive spider web to keep up with. Two examples of this would be [It's Called: Freefall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2WDdccgaDY)
and [Wishful Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkGpXtUxEw0). Both of these could belong in CALM, (which really just turned into
indie rock), JAM, and at least Wishful Thinking could belong in DREAM. To help with this, I had this thing where the first four songs are 
immovable. If I had this question, I would look to those four songs. They made up the thumbnail! It's basically a Constitution.

Curating these playlists followed a simple workflow. First, I would find music by using the radio or through traditional methods. Normally, this was 
recommendations from friends, tiktok, the Spotify radio, and my personal favorite: shazaming the song that someone is playing in their
car while I'm riding with them. It's great when I'm riding with someone one day, steal a song or two, and then when they're riding in
my car, they hear their song! And I am very forthcoming about how I stole from them. If there's a universal rule I can say about humans,
it's that they like getting their taste in music validated.

Once a song is selected, next it's added to Liked Songs. Liked Songs is cheap. Everything goes through Liked Songs. Liked Songs is
ephemeral. The goal of Liked Songs is to not have Liked Songs. Liked Songs is the firewall protecting my playlists from having
hastily-added songs in them. A playlist should not have a song in them that wasn't first listened to thoroughly for quality and relevance.
The last step of the process is to purge Liked Songs. Either promote promising pieces into perfectly procured playlists, or rescind the refrain's
reservation, recognizing return is rare.

The funny thing is, I did not do the final step in all of 2023. Today I cleared 173 Liked Songs - the earliest dating back to November 2022. This
is what I meant by my listening habits sometimes annoy me. I stopped listening to Spotify as much in favor of >1 hour mixes/albums on
YouTube, notably post-rock, lofi, synth, and more recently breakcore and jungle. All of these genres have something in common in that it's hard
to distinguish between any particular song unless you have a deep appreciation. I can remember a rapper's voice, but a guitar solo? It's
hard to pin that on a specific artist. As such, discovery seems more difficult and why bother when the mixes that the YT algorithm gives
me is so good? I can tell your nonsense detectors are going off because they're going off for me too. I'm kind of dependent on the algorithm,
not just to new find music but to play music that I like! I do have a YT playlist of certain mixes/albums I like, but I'm not meticulous at all
at keeping up with it.

On average, my time listening to music on YouTube is worse than on Spotify because of how I use the platforms. I have missed listening to songs
like the one we listened to the other night, [Posing For Cars by Japanese Breakfast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYRggL-EITY).
Focused listening is what I need more of. Post-rock and lofi are great, but they don't make me sit back
in my chair, interrupting the article I was reading or the code I was writing. Sometimes I don't want to be interrupted,
but what I've learned is that there is such thing as too much background music. I should allow myself to be interrupted by fantastic music.

Tonight I finally put in the elbow grease into fixing my Spotify. I purged my Liked Songs, even though I probably hastily added
some and unliked others. I also combined several playlists together - such as my COPII and DARK playlists, now it's just 'synth' (new name pending). This
is because there is a surprising amount of overlap between a typical song in COPII (named my friend who got me into this music), 
[Moonlight by XXXTENTACION](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GX8Hg6kWQYI) and songs like [почему,почему? (why,why?) by niteboi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rRW5R755l0) 
that were in DARK (very creative naming, I'm aware). If you don't think they are similar, that's fine, I could probably find a better example.

These combinations were hard to do, and I did them to my favorite playlists. I hope this consolidation makes the choice overload issue go away,
as well as allowing my to properly sort songs to where they should go. A symptom of too many playlists is that the same song might go in two or three, possibly
four! That's not great! I'm thinking about making a website where it finds all of the duplicate songs and forces me to pick one playlist to put it in. Might be fun.

It's funny because it's almost like I brought technical debt into Spotify. Just like my Factorio world, and most certainly my playlist-powertools project,
sometimes a refactor is necessary. 

I'm very excited to listen to music with you.

Love you sweetie,

Nathan
