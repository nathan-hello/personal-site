This has been a big year for me. I got a new job, new place, and my beautiful wife is here in the US.

A part of this new job is making UIs in a WYSIWYG editor that was made 20 years ago with icon packs
from 5 years ago. I think it compiles down to some kind of HTML but it's impossible to tell because it's
all propietary garbage. It's really difficult to make functional UIs in this because there's no JS
to control the behavior of the components - actually there's not components at all. I might do an entire
post about surviving Crestron's VTPro, but that will be on my future A/V programming series.

I want to ramble and ramble about Crestron stuff but either a) my thoughts aren't coherent enough
to be in a well written blog post (I hold myself to a high standard!) or b) my thoughts are too
well put together such that it's a Code Tutorial and holy moly I don't want to write another one
of those it was really hard and I didn't like it at all. Code stuff belongs in videos or books.

This post is just here to say hi. I haven't felt like working on the site (go rewrite when??), 
and I haven't had the time to do a full blog post. I've had a few ideas though, and I'll try to
push forward to actually write it. All of my ideas have been lost to me not writing them down...

I'd also like to have more specific posts. I kind of drift about sometimes or split the post in two.
Seems like bad form.

Again, just saying hi (oh! and that I love my wife)

Have fun,

nathan
