This post is about my experience with dreams - I'll try to keep my dream anecdotes to a minimum because
let's face it - other people's dreams are not interesting. Towards the end I'll put a website update (a lot of little things!)

Active dreaming was a superpower when I was a child. I could fly, manipulate things, talk to people,
work things out, ignore my problems. It was a proper escape that I had a good chance of achieving
in any given week or so. I remember a dream where my alarm was going off while I was in my old
home in South Carolina. Desperate to not miss school, I figured out how to concentrate to just
so slightly move my real-life shoulder and make it to the bus on time. This skill would prove
immesurably useful for the rest of my life. The ability to exit a dream whenever I figured out
that I was in one would save me from countless hours of nightmares and generally boring dreams.

Do you ever have boring dreams? Usually it happens in an instant - so quick that it's very much
possible that I was going to wake up anyways and saying "I'm bored" was my brain's convinient excuse
for waking up prematurely. I've woken up laughing at what just happened in my dreams. Sometimes my
dream makes an argument at me. Like a meditation state where my psyche wanted me to consider something
that an awake, sober brain would have never thought of. About twice a month, I get sleep paralysis. Data
on this is a bit fudged because I deliberately stopped keeping track of my dreams, good or bad. There was a long
time where the bad outweighed the good.

As a kid, I remember Vsauce and the rest of the science youtube people, as well as my friends at school
talk about lucid dreaming. I never really perfected the on-demand lucid dream, but I had plenty of them
without any effort - it seemed a waste of time to try. Although, remembering dreams was something I cared about.
There was so much life in them, so I would write them down to remember them. You forget your dreams because
your brain doesn't find them worthwhile - well, if you write them down and make an exercise to remember them,
your brain says "Oh, this is important to us, alright let's not dump it 5 minutes after waking up".

So, that's what I did for awhile. I don't remember how I kept track of them, but I remember making an effort to
write them down in my phone or a notepad whenever an okay one rolled around. 

Then, the nightmares started to creep up more and more. Or, not even nightmares, but a complicated drama that
would make me wake up in a tissy. I didn't like these so I made an effort to forget the dreams - no more logging
them, no more analysis, no more stress. This has worked for the most part and is why I say that dreams are overrated.
I've found that I sleep better when I wake up unencumbered by the story that unfolded during the night.

The paralysis part I don't think changed that much, but it certainly helps when the scope is smaller. Most of my
paralysis dreams are without any sight, just a voice and some explanation as to why I can't move. I got these when I
was a child too. Most traumatically, the narrator in my dream would lock my eyes onto some object - something that is
innocent but telepathically tells me how evil it is, how it wants to do this and that. Obviously you don't control yourself
in most dreams, but to be told under no uncertain terms that you can't move or look away from something, with an accompanying
sense of doom, it's just too much. There is probably a normal distribution of active dreaming, where in the middle is most people
and they're fine, and the people on the left that wonder what all the fuss is about. I'm convinced I'm on the right side of that
distribution - more dreams and more dramatic dreams than most people. 

I would happily go to the lesser-dream side of the spectrum any day of the week. Sleep is for sleep, and the best part about
sleep is feeling well rested. Even my most fun dreams were only fun for less than an hour after I wake up. After that, I go about
my day and life my life. Dreams don't help me in any way, except for one.

The dream that had an argument at me was when I was deciding on how much my family meant to me. I hadn't talked to my family
in awhile, I had ongoing fights with some, contempt for others, and I was considering going cold turkey on them. This dream
showed me a nice day with my extended family, and said "This is what you can lose if you don't keep up with your relationships. 
You can't expect everyone to hang by your side after you allow the relationships to wither away." That's something I'm grateful for,
but boy is there so much bad stuff. I was almost late to work just the other day because I had four hours to sleep (skill issue on my
part, for sure), and I had a nightmare in the middle of it. After a nightmare, I'll just distract myself with some media until I'm
no longer scared of the nightmare continuing, but it's a bit of time and lost precious REM. 

The paralysis dreams are, like I said, about twice a month, but they don't bother me too much. Many of the paralysis dreams are fine?
They don't bother me, I just relax like a chinese finger trap and wake up. The more you freak out during one the more anxious you become,
making the whole situation worse. 

If you're someone who has frequent nightmares, consider the fact that alcohol consumption makes nightmares much more common. Alcohol is
awful for you in so many ways, and sleep quality is one of them. I don't drink very often, and drunk dreams are iirc kinda fun for me,
but maximizing dreams is the last thing in the world I care about. 

When I get into bed, I just want some rest. No games, no flying, I want to wake up refreshed and ready to tackle the day. 


#### Website update!

The site now has a couple new pages, an updated (read: stolen from Natalie's side) header, and the colors on the home page are cooler now.
The best colors for the home page are grey and a different shade of grey, but doing that looks kinda boring so we're not doing that. There is
the [irc](/irc) page for showing you how to get to the IRC server, and the [js](/js) page for telling you where in our site has JS and what
disabling JS would mean for you. On the [tv](/natalie/tv) page, Natalie figured out how to get the HLS stream's TLS certs to be properly signed,
so there's no question on the authenticity of the stream you see. The site is open source still, at the updated /gh/ tag in the header, so 
give a looksy and tell me what you think. We did a lot of refactoring today to make the layouts easier to work with and more Natalie-proof (love
you sweetie). Also the Meta.astro was fixed so that when you link it in discord or twitter or whereever, it showes a nice [thumbnail](/images/banner.gif)
if it's a non-blog post (it looks so cool! I'm really happy that Natalie did that it's really cool looking and she's really smart and I love her a lot a lot),
as well as the title and description of what's going on. I wanted to add a checkbox where if you clicked it, it would hide the content on the page so 
you could appreciate Natalie's really great choice in backgrounds, but I couldn't get it to work. Anyways, I hope you like our little site :)
