## Nate is a goober

I have my tisms as well, and to be fair I've never made a website, so I couldn't tell you the first thing about this stuff. However I have messed around with html and css and it doesn't seem like it would need as much fenangaling as astro to 'just work'.

But regardless, this is very cute, and when I can figure out how to use css I can't wait to do stuff with astro. The idea of render time JS is interesting. It doesn't negate the possibility of doing fingerprinting and other shenanigens during render time, which is my main gripe with the language and how it's abused. For example [this](/startpage.html) startpage that I use for my browser and it kinda just works.
