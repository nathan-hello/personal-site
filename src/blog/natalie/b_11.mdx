Recently I have started reading and watching a lot of media from when I was younger for a variety of reasons. But mainly a combination of nostalgia and also wising to understand what others might refer to as classics. There are a lot of [sites](https://koshka.love/babel/normiefication.html) not much unlike our own that discuss the trends of the internet and how they have diverged from what they once were. However I'd more like to discuss the efforts people take to try and recreate that in a containerised form. From hosting all your services [yourself](https://landchad.net/) to recreating media such as these videos by [some japanese guy](https://youtube.com/channel/UCcegcJA0ijqaZUUyvGtr5xQ) that uses blender to create low poly cgi models to create animations and then records the output to VHS. This is honestly quite well done in an attempt to recreate old media, especially given that the result was recorded and then digitised from VHS, now there are a couple things that gets me: one is the inconsistant 'low poly count' as the hands stand out for me, relative to everything else in the scenes. you either go low poly for everything equally without any textures or reflections, or you go high poly but keep the shapes basic without too much detail. 
the animation is also just, too ... smooth? 
in the 80s and even part of the 90s doing 30 FPS or higher in 3D was very expensive. artists would stick to the "cinematic" 24 FPS if they could afford it, if not they would only go lower.
I can't put my finger on this one, but almost every Blender render looks modern. I don't know if it's shaders or just the renderer itself but it always has that very unique Blender look that feels modern.
Regardless, I might set up an irc server, I'm not sure how many people might use it but again an article by [koshka](https://koshka.love/babel/irc-forever.html) about the benefits of text only communication. I've always been enamoured by it but the communities that exist there are very much centered around tech only topics or are preexisting friend groups. Which are great but alot of the other fringe cultures now seem to be in imageboards or directly in corporate walled gardens. No longer will we have shenanigens (though channel raids are cringe af). 
Russian:
```
Sashok: Здравствуйте, это канал об аниме?
Да.
Sashok: Как мне пропатчить KDE2 под FreeBSD?
```
English:
```
Sashok: Hello, is this the '#anime' channel?
Yes.
Sashok: How does one patch KDE2 under FreeBSD?
```
Oh well, perhaps I might create something more cohesive in a bit.
