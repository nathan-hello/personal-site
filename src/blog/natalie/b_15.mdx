I dislike the internet.

Before I elaborate I must explain that on the internet especially its very easy to build a small garden for yourself which you very rarely venture out of. I try my best to go on internet adventures and find new avenues (I promise they will be documented in links one day). Just in case I may come across a treasure. This thought process too has now unfortunately become rare as well. As many are used to having their consumption of media be regulated by others. tv and radio were the original sin when it came to unabashed corprotism. But now I must say goodbye to and vestige of the internet when it was ran by your local nerd.

With the migration of more and more communities into walled gardens, it creates an inertia which is very difficult to repel. Leaving those that would rather do away with them stuck regardless. Whether this be from work or school, friends, online or in person. Every tool is an obfuscated and proprietary gui on top of something that has existed for 20 years or more. For an example a friend of mine who recently began exploring new software came across the age old question of, how does one share files with one another?? These days I'm a firm believer in syncthing and ftp for such things. But said friend showed me a website which would detect others on your local network whom were also on the site and establish an ftp server and client between them. Nothing extraordinary but it makes you think. The spot we are in now is of course a culmination of many factors and I would like to at least address a few pressing ones. 

One is mobile phones, due to their small size it makes anything serious to be done on them restrictively difficult. And hence something as seemingly simple as sending files on an ftp server now requires a website with (a not insignificant amount of javascript) just because for interactions premediated with touch it is the only logical avenue for design.

Another is the tools for editing software and interacting with code a sorely missing from some of the biggest operating systems that people use. I won't address phones in this case as that is already a lost cause. But in the desktop and laptop market windows and macos dominate. But neither have any built in toolchains to actually interact with code. Both require you to download development enviroments. Which means one must first access the internet before even being able to compile code. Which is completely backwards. This abstraction away from the core principles of computers is one of the biggest leading factors in tech illiteracy in my non professional or peer reviewed opinion.

The third is the internet which I have touched on momentarily in both previous paragraphs. But for a decentralised system has become very much not so on every level, dns resolving and CA certificate authorities, an oligopoly. Messaging (check out the [irc](https://www.reluekiss.com/irc)) and file sharing, oligopoly. And for paticular forms of media, monopolies. But even so, this is almost definitely exacerbated my modern website design. Many are of the opinion that one should always account for the lowest common denominator. But if you continue to only ever account for the lowest common denominator people will only ever become less literate and more reliant on the powers that be to save them from themselves. If you were to look merely 20 to 30 years ago one would need to be able to set up their modem to allow for access to the internet and then dial up your provider. And any technical firmware or driver issue would require a little bit of thought. Even these very small things would mean people had some sense of mastery over the devices they use and probably more common sense rather than replacing the entire device at the first sense of trouble.

If I were to change things at the press of a button and repeal the decades of illiteracy and oligarcal control I would do so. But until that point, try to engage with the internet with vigour, embrace anonymity, decentralisation, technical literacy, non-commercialisation and freedom of speech (these are taken from [here](https://koshka.love/mwwwga.html) who has some thoughts of their own on this very topic).

Learning can be a very hard but is also a very rewarding process, and for a device I know you the reader use every day you could do with knowing a little more about it.
