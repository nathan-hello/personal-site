        alt: Neighbourhoods U and V of x in X.

Ok something a bit more interesting, and which is a bit more topological in nature.

**5.** Show that if a space $X$ deformation retracts to a point $x\in X$, then for each neighborhood $U$ of $x \in X \exists$, a neighborhood $V \subset U$ of $x$ such that the inclusion map $V\hookrightarrow U$ is nullhomotopic.

Strap in, cause this is gonna be a long one. We're gonna start off with an idea from point set topology, namely, if a space $X$ is contractible $\Longleftrightarrow$ $1_X$ is null homotopic.

Let us define a set of maps $f_t : X \to X$ be a deformation retraction. Such that $f_t(\{x\}) = \{x\}, \forall t, f_1(X) = \{x\}$. We shall take for face value the result of question 4 even if we didn't prove it, we can define a map $\iota : \{x\} \to X$ such that $f_1 \iota : \{x\} \to \{x\} \simeq 1_{\{x\}}, \iota f_1 : X \to X \simeq 1_X$. Now, if we have a map $g_t : X \to X$ such that $g_1 = \iota f_1 : X \to X$ and $g_0 = 1_X$ and let U be a neighbourhood of x. Since $g_t$ is continuous in $t$, $\exists t_0 \in I : t> t_0, g^{-1}_t(U) \subset U$ and for $t<t_0,g^{-1}_t(U) = U$. Now let $V=g^{-1}_t$ and construct a normalised coordinate, $s = \frac{t}{t_0}$, $t \in [0, t_0]$ and define $h:U \times I \to V$, $h(x,s) = g_{st_0}|_U(x)$.

Gosh that was a headache, but rephrasing all that in terms of $h_t$ means that since $f_t$ is a deformation retraction in the strong sense, implies that $h$ is a deformation retraction in the weak sense from $V$ to $\{x\}$. So the equivalent $\widetilde{\iota}: \{x\} \to V$ is a homotopy equivalence and $h_1 \widetilde{\iota} \simeq 1_{\{x\}}$ (ie null homotopic). Whooooooo!! Theres a diagram below for easier visualisation.

$$U \underset{\iota}{\overset{g_{t_0}}{\rightleftarrows}} V \underset{\widetilde{\iota}}{\overset{h_1}{\rightleftarrows}} \{x\}$$

Now, since $h_1 \widetilde{\iota}$ is null-homotopic and $\iota :U \to V$ is homotopic to $1_V$ via $f$, this implies that by multiplying the homotopies $g_t * h_t$ $[ *$ is the group operation of $\pi_1(X)]$ (Is the fundamental group, which will be covered in chaper 1, idk how else I should say this, so leave me a reply when that becomes a thing), we get that $\iota$ is null-homotopic. $\square$

And that's all folks. I am now the eeper.
