Yes I will work on more Hatcher stuff soon, (I have one in the works but putting it on here is a bit of a pain atm cause I haven't automated it yet and I also just haven't finished it yet).

Also, 4chan is so cucked lmao, i have a bookmark that i usually use that goes straight to the /tg/ catalog but i wanted to change it be the homepage and there was a fricking cloudflare ddos captcha on it, which
- a). is dum and would waste my time
- b). doesn't even work on my old ass browser
- c). can just be completely bypassed if i just go straight to the board

But on a more normal note, hi Nate, in one of your earlier posts you mentioned talking to each other through these posts and I thought that was really cute, I wasn't sure if I wished to do that through my maths stuff, so this is here for now. Question of the post! What should we do in the US while I'm over there in the summer? It'll be a while and I know you'll be doing work, but it would be really nice to meet some friends while over there (on the east coast at least).

Also, gotta get a working rss feed at some point. (For those that don't use them, they're really damn useful, I might do a write up about them one day)
