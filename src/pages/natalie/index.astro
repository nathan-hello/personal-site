            "Hey hi, welcome you goobers, this is my little hang out spot (watchout for Nate he
            likes to invade, but he is just a silly). Aaaanyway, I'm nat, nice to meetcha, and
            here you can find the paticular tidbits that are currently interesting me, get ready
            for maths and computer stuff cause that's pretty much all I do [I joke, but sometimes
            its a little :))]" - nat 11/01/24 - 01:24+0000 OH FUCK IT'S LATE, OK I'LL FINISH THIS
            LATER\
            <br />
            Ok I'm back and I'm finishing it later tm, idk if this should be an about me or if
            I should just do it here but for now it'll be here and if that changes I'll link to
            that page here.
            <br />
            But I guess, here we go, there's not much to say. I'm 20, doing a bsc in maths, I'm
            a bonger and I spend most of my time on my computer, either fiddling with it cause
            my brain won't leave me alone unless it's 'good'. But for my media consumption, I enjoy
            songs by

            and most other forms of post punk, russian or otherwise.

            I haven't played many games as of recently but I would definitely put oblivion, AoE2,
            M&B warband and HoMM 3 as my favrouites. Mainly cause I just play them a lot.
            <br />
            I really enjoy looking around at websites and I would like to make a page just full
            of links, maybe something like
            <a 
                class="text-nat-white-c01 no-underline hover:text-nat-black-c01 hover:bg-nat-white-c01"

            Ok so the big two are maths and computers, the former is far too long to write
            about here but I have started a little mini series where I work through Allen Hatchers
            Introduction to Algebraic Topology, just as a refresher for my brain
            <a 
                class="text-nat-white-c01 no-underline hover:text-nat-black-c01 hover:bg-nat-white-c01"

            </a>.
            <br />
            With computers, I guess I should explain mine, I use void with dwm, there's a lot
            of extreneous software I use like
            <a 
                class="text-nat-white-c01 no-underline hover:text-nat-black-c01 hover:bg-nat-white-c01"

                [qutebrowser]
            </a>
            and
            <a 
                class="text-nat-white-c01 no-underline hover:text-nat-black-c01 hover:bg-nat-white-c01"

            </a>
            , however all that you need to know is that I like to keep the software I use as
            simple and unobtrusive as possible. I won't plague you with another rant on free
            software, there's a million of those out there so

            is one. As that is not the main reason I use it, but just that it works for me.
